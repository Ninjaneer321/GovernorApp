{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Les ministères du gouvernement du Canada (GC) ont recours à des systèmes d’information pour soutenir leurs activités opérationnelles. Ces systèmes interconnectés font souvent l’objet de sérieuses menaces susceptibles d’influer négativement sur leurs activités en compromettant la confidentialité, l’intégrité ou la disponibilité de leurs systèmes et de leurs biens de technologie de l’information (TI). L’appui de la haute direction est vital à la protection continue des applications administratives, des biens d’information et des infrastructures de TI. Le présent bulletin identifie les principales questions qui permettront d’orienter les discussions de haut niveau entre la direction et l’équipe de la Sécurité des TI en vue de renforcer la sécurité nationale, de protéger l’information sensible du GC et d’assurer la réalisation des objectifs de mission de leur ministère.\r\n","en":"Government of Canada (GC) departments rely on information systems to support their business activities.
