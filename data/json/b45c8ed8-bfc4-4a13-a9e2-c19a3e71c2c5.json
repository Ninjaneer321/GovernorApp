{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Des dénombrements d’oiseaux par points d'écoute sont effectués chaque année grâce à la collecte et à la transcription d’enregistrements acoustiques. Les stations d’enregistrement sont situées le long de 11 transects et sont visitées le matin, entre la fin de mai et le début de juillet. Les chants et les cris de toutes les espèces identifiables sont consignés. Étant donné qu’ils sont sensibles aux changements environnementaux, qu’ils sont répandus et qu’il est facile d’en faire le relevé, les oiseaux chanteurs migrateurs constituent un excellent indicateur de la santé de l’écosystème forestier.","en":"Avian point counts are conducted annually by collecting and transcribing acoustic recordings.
