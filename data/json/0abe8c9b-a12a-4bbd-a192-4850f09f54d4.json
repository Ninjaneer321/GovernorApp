{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"\"Les dispositifs mobiles sont des outils opérationnels importants qui facilitent les communications du gouvernement et permettent aux employés d’exécuter leurs tâches de manière efficace et opportune. Les dispositifs mobiles utilisent un microphone pour les communications vocales cellulaires, l’enregistrement et les commandes vocales.\r\n\r\nLorsque le microphone est activé, la communication pourrait être à risque. Les auteurs de menaces peuvent installer des logiciels malveillants (maliciels) qui leur permettent d'activer le microphone des dispositifs à distance. Lorsque le microphone est activé, un auteur de menaces peut enregistrer des conversations ayant lieu jusqu'à 20 mètres de loin et transmettre l'information obtenue à leurs homologues sans que vous en ayez connaissance.\r\n\r\nPour contrer cette menace, une fiche bloque-son, également appelée bouchon, a été conçue pour imiter un casque d’écoute externe. Dans les anciennes versions des dispositifs mobiles, l'insertion du bouchon dans la prise de casque d'écoute désactivait le haut-parleur et le microphone internes.\"\r\n","en":"\"Mobile devices are important business tools that help government employees communicate and perform their duties in an effective and timely manner.
