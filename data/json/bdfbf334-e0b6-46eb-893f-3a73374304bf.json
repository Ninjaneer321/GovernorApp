{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Ce livret a deux objectifs : aider les enfants à apprendre quelques notions de base du droit de la famille et leur donner une idée des démarches que leurs parents pourraient entreprendre quand ils se séparent.\r\n\r\nIl vise également à aider les enfants à comprendre que leur réaction émotive au divorce de leurs parents est normale. Ce livret encourage les enfants à parler à des personnes en qui ils ont confiance — leurs parents, leurs grands-parents, un oncle, une tante, un ami de la famille, un voisin ou une personne de leur collectivité, comme leur école, leur église, leur synagogue ou leur mosquée.\r\n\r\nLe niveau de langue utilisé et les activités que l’on propose sont adaptés aux enfants. Toutefois, certains pourraient avoir besoin d’aide pour lire le livret.\r\n\r\nD’autres pourraient vouloir qu’on les aide. Ils pourraient vouloir qu’un adulte en qui ils ont confiance les guide tout au long de leur lecture, pour les aider à se familiariser avec des notions juridiques importantes et à surmonter leur sentiment de perte, leur colère, leur confusion ou leur anxiété, au besoin.\r\n\r\nCe livret est conçu pour être lu d’une couverture à l’autre ou par chapitre. Les enfants peuvent lire seulement les chapitres qui les intéressent, puis, au besoin, revenir en arrière pour lire les chapitres précédents.\r\n\r\nPuisque cette publication s’adresse aux enfants, de nombreux renseignements techniques et juridiques ont été laissés de côté. On y trouve uniquement des renseignements très généraux, car le droit de la famille est un sujet complexe, et quelques-uns de ses aspects sont différents selon les provinces et les territoires du Canada.","en":"This booklet has two purposes.

Kids can read only the chapters that interest them. They can always go back to other chapters later if they need to.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a booklet for children, a lot of technical, legal information has been left out.
