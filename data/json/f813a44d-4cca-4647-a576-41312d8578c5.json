{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Ce rapport contient les résultats de l'évaluation du programme Services de qualification et d'essais de l'Agence spatiale canadienne (ASC). Le Laboratoire David Florida (LDF), qui est situé à Ottawa, en Ontario, constitue le principal mécanisme au moyen duquel le programme est réalisé. Ce programme exécute des activités et des services spécialisés axés sur l'assemblage, l'intégration et l'essai (AIE) de systèmes et d'équipements spatiaux (p. ex., des satellites et des composants) pour le compte de l'ASC et de clients externes établis au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde. Le programme a pour objectif de veiller à ce que les systèmes entiers et les technologies assignées à une mission fonctionnent bien et en toute sécurité dans les conditions rigoureuses de l'espace. \r\n\r\nL'étude a été réalisée d'avril à septembre 2014 pour le compte de la Direction, Audit et évaluation de l'ASC par un consortium dirigé par Kelly Sears Consulting Group. L'évaluation constitue une exigence du Plan d'évaluation quinquennal de l'ASC, lequel respecte la Politique sur l'évaluation du Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor (2009) qui exige que tous les programmes fédéraux soient évalués tous les cinq ans. Un groupe consultatif d'évaluation (GCE), formé de représentants de l'ASC (du siège social de Saint-Hubert et du LDF), a orienté le travail de l'équipe de consultation. \r\n\r\nL'évaluation a misé sur les méthodes suivantes : examen d'un nombre important de documents et de publications, réalisation de 44 entrevues avec des représentants de l'ASC et des clients externes du LDF, et analyse comparative de huit autres installations d'AIE d'autres pays.

The David Florida Laboratory (DFL), located in Ottawa, Ontario, is the main mechanism through which the program is delivered. This program carries out specialized activities and services for the assembly, integration and testing (AIT) of space hardware (e.g., satellites and components) on behalf of the CSA and external clients, both in Canada and internationally. The program exists to ensure that mission-assigned technology and entire systems can safely and reliably meet the rigours of space.\r\n\r\nThe study was conducted between April and September 2014 on behalf of the CSA Audit and Evaluation Directorate by a consortium of firms led by Kelly Sears Consulting Group. The evaluation is a requirement of the CSA five-year evaluation plan, which, in accordance with Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's Policy on Evaluation (2009) requiring that all federal programs be evaluated every five years. An Evaluation Consultative Group, consisting of representatives from the CSA (St. Hubert and the DFL) guided the work of the consulting team.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation involved the following methods: a review of a considerable amount of documentation and literature; the conduct of 44 interviews within the CSA and with external DFL clients; and a benchmarking study of eight other AIT facilities in other countries."},"issn":"","imso_approval":"true","isbn":"","creator":"","org_section":{"fr":"","en":""},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"asc.gouvernementouvert-opengovernment.csa@canada.ca","num_tags":0,"edition":"","frequency":"not_planned","data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"","en":""},"contributor":{"fr":"","en":""},"maintainer":null,"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"f813a44d-4cca-4647-a576-41312d8578c5","metadata_created":"2017-01-24T15:30:18.513924","subject":["government_and_politics","science_and_technology"],"pspc_identification_number":"","metadata_modified":"2021-05-07T20:20:15.889979","author":null,"author_email":null,"geographic_region":[],"portal_release_date":"2017-01-24","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"keywords":{"fr":["Agence
