{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Le présent rapport propose un examen des données relatives à la violence au sein des familles, et la présente comme étant un facteur pertinent dont il faut tenir compte dans les litiges en droit de la famille. Dans le contexte du droit de la famille, la violence, la maltraitance et la négligence au sein des familles peuvent engendrer une grande variété de répercussions à long terme. Les tribunaux de la famille et les tribunaux criminels peuvent rendre des décisions contraires qui créent de la confusion et de la frustration et qui pourraient exposer les membres d’une famille à des risques. Et cela entraîne des conséquences sur les plans financier et humain.","en":"This report offers an examination of data on violence within families, highlighting how it may be a relevant factor to consider in a family law dispute.
