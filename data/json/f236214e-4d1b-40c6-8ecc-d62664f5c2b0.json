{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Historiquement, il y avait deux colonies de chardon de Pitcher dans le parc national Pukaskwa, les deux à Oiseau Bay (Creek Beach et Crescent Beach). En 1985, les fortes tempêtes ont déplacé le cours du ruisseau Oiseau et son embouchure. Cela a modifié l'habitat dunaire et mené au déclin du chardon de Pitcher dans le secteur. Parcs Canada a depuis établi trois nouvelles colonies en prélevant des graines dans des colonies existantes et en les dispersant dans des endroits appropriés [Middle Beach (établi en 1991), Tombolo (établi en 2013) et Oiseau Creek (établi en 2013)]. Pour le suivi, chaque colonie est divisée en parcelles et un recensement complet est effectué. De 1982 à 2014, toutes les plantes ont été identifiées et suivies individuellement. Les données suivantes ont été recueillies: le stade de développement de la plante, son habitat, le nombre de tiges, le nombre de têtes, le nombre de têtes en floraison, tout signe de dégâts par la pyrale, et si la plante avait perdue son étiquette d'identification. Depuis 2015, les colonies sont suivies en comptant le nombre de semis, de rosettes et de plantes à fleurs dans chaque parcelle. Ce projet vise à atteindre les objectifs de la stratégie de rétablissement de l'espèce en maintenant et restaurant 3 colonies à Pukaskwa avec un nombre stable de plantes et un minimum de 800 individus.","en":"Historically, Pukaskwa had two naturally occurring populations of Pitcher’s Thistle; Creek Beach and Crescent beach, both located in Oiseau Bay.  On Sept. 22 & 23, 1985 there was a severe windstorm that severely affected the beach at Oiseau Bay and caused erosion at the colony site and then on June 26, 1986, there was a severe thunderstorm with heavy rain that caused the washout of a huge portion of the Crescent Beach colony. Both of the colonies have shown negative population trends to the point where the Crescent Beach colony is now considered extirpated.  From 1982 to 2014, each location was divided into plots and within each plot, each plant was tagged with a unique identifier using dymo tape and a bicycle spoke. The life stage of the plant, the habitat it is in, the number of stems, the number of heads and flowering heads, whether it was affected by plume moth, and if the plant was missing, dead or if the tag was missing or removed were recorded.  In 2015, the protocol changed so that only the number of seedlings, rosettes and flowering plants per plot is recorded.  In 1991, Middle Beach was planted by seed and has been surveyed in the same way since 1992. This project aims to achieve the species' recovery strategy goals by maintaining and restoring 3 colonies in Pukaskwa, with a minimum of 800 plants total and that all have acceptable fluctuations (colonies show stable trends with no more than 30% decline in 1 year)."},"imso_approval":"true","maintainer":null,"creator":"Christine Drake","association_type":[],"org_section":{"fr":"","en":""},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"Christine.drake@pc.gc.ca","num_tags":0,"contributor":{"fr":"","en":""},"frequency":"P1Y","keywords":{"fr":["Le chardon de Pitcher","Cirsium pitcheri","restauration","espèces en péril","gestion active"],"en":["Pitcher’s Thistle","Cirsium Pitcheri","Pukaskwa","restoration","species at risk"]},"data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"","en":""},"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"f236214e-4d1b-40c6-8ecc-d62664f5c2b0","metadata_created":"2018-04-12T18:16:09.416160","subject":["nature_and_environment"],"spatial_representation_type":[],"metadata_modified":"2018-04-12T18:16:09.416190","author":null,"author_email":null,"geographic_region":["3"],"position_name":{},"portal_release_date":"2018-04-12","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"relationships_as_object":[],"time_period_coverage_start":"2013-10-07 00:00:00","title_translated":{"fr":"Le chardon de Pitcher - Pukaskwa","en":"Pitcher's Thistle - Pukaskwa"},"type":"dataset","resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"f236214e-4d1b-40c6-8ecc-d62664f5c2b0","datastore_active":false,"id":"8a37826a-41a2-4a33-9329-13e3fd5cc112","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Le chardon de Pitcher - Données de relevé - Pukaskwa","en":"Pitcher's Thistle - Survey Data- Pukaskwa"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"CSV","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Pitcher's Thistle - Survey Data- Pukaskwa","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2018-04-12T18:16:09.879779","url":"https://124gc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/external/_layouts/15/download.aspx/EfZDhvKdZ3hGjxsmhqwzI08BJWxaYFKedIyfpEOjpPesyw?e=xytPAb","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":0,"revision_id":"04c0dcf8-85bb-4c4b-bcf1-c0e850bdbcac","resource_type":"dataset"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"f236214e-4d1b-40c6-8ecc-d62664f5c2b0","datastore_active":false,"id":"ffe58af7-58c4-4851-aeae-f00469064939","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Le chardon de Pitcher - Données de habitat - Pukaskwa","en":"Pitcher's Thistle - Habitat Data- Pukaskwa"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"CSV","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Pitcher's Thistle - Habitat Data- Pukaskwa","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2018-04-12T18:16:09.879790","url":"https://124gc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/external/_layouts/15/download.aspx/EQGxN-pX-5RAtF6-w_PkEa4BsRoyEKJe8_AFaw-x-KGEhg?e=oyf6lC","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":1,"revision_id":"04c0dcf8-85bb-4c4b-bcf1-c0e850bdbcac","resource_type":"dataset"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"f236214e-4d1b-40c6-8ecc-d62664f5c2b0","datastore_active":false,"id":"fd141149-6a85-4619-a17d-ee0653b5ef90","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Le chardon de Pitcher - Données de restauration - Pukaskwa","en":"Pitcher's Thistle - Restoration Data- Pukaskwa"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"CSV","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Pitcher's Thistle - Restoration Data- Pukaskwa","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2018-04-12T18:16:09.879796","url":"https://124gc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/external/_layouts/15/download.aspx/EcNxl68lFTpPoqgvgnVJLwcBicqOLWP5WSpXDymy1mxIqA?e=FYW9dG","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":2,"revision_id":"04c0dcf8-85bb-4c4b-bcf1-c0e850bdbcac","resource_type":"dataset"}],"place_of_publication":[],"metadata_contact":{},"num_resources":3,"topic_category":[],"tags":[],"spatial":"","collection":"primary","org_title_at_publication":{"fr":"Parcs Canada","en":"Parks Canada"},"date_published":"2017-10-01 00:00:00","display_flags":[],"groups":[],"creator_user_id":"4cfa9a9c-1d95-40eb-86f9-bc0c8ec45d1f","data_series_name":{"fr":"","en":""},"relationships_as_subject":[],"license_title":"Open Government Licence - Canada","time_period_coverage_end":"2013-10-08 00:00:00","restrictions":"unrestricted","organization":{"description":"","created":"2016-09-23T17:25:55.332385","title":"Parks Canada | Parcs Canada","name":"pc","is_organization":true,"state":"active","image_url":"","revision_id":"60bec185-5958-4293-a752-446149f49a8a","type":"organization","id":"B578A1C3-FDCF-4F36-89E2-3B2E75020C43","approval_status":"approved"},"name":"f236214e-4d1b-40c6-8ecc-d62664f5c2b0","isopen":false,"license_id":"ca-ogl-lgo","url":"","notes":"Historically, Pukaskwa had two naturally occurring populations of Pitcher’s Thistle; Creek Beach and Crescent beach, both located in Oiseau Bay.
