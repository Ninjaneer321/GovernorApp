{"notes_translated":{"fr":"La première édition de l'Atlas du Canada (1906) comprend une carte qui démontre les canaux de même que l'emplacement et les types de phares le long du St-Laurent et des Grands Lacs. De plus, la carte démontre les routes de navigation sur ces plans d'eau. Un tableau indique les distances de navigation, en mille géographique, entre les ports des États-Unis et du Canada (Grands Lacs et St-Laurent). À partir de 1903-1904, on peut voir sur la carte, les statistiques sur les cargaisons et le traffic passagers sur les canaux ainsi que les coûts totaux d'entretien et de construction. On peut aussi y voir les routes de navigation des navires à vapeur à partir des ports canadiens en destination d'autres ports du Canada et des États-Unis. Les phares sont divisés en trois catégories; fixes, rotatifs et bateaux-phares. La profondeur des eaux des Grands Lacs est indiquée par les courbes de niveau et les teintes de bleu. Les parties les plus profondes sont d'un bleu plus foncé tandis que les parties les moins profondes d'un bleu plus clair.","en":"Contained within the 1st Edition (1906) of the Atlas of Canada is a map that shows canals, as well as locations and types of Lighthouses along the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes. In addition, the map also shows sailing routes through those water bodies. There is a table of sailing distances, in geographical miles, between the ports of the United States and Canada on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence. Statistics of freight and passenger traffic through the canals, total cost of maintenance, and the construction of Canadian canals, are shown as of 1903-1904. There are also steamship routes from Canadian ports to other ports in Canada and in the U.S. The lighthouses are distinguished between fixed, revolving lights, and light ships. The depth of the water of the Great Lakes is indicated by contours and tints of blue. The deeper portions are shown in the darker tints, while lighter tints indicate more shallow waters."},"imso_approval":"true","maintainer":null,"association_type":[],"org_section":{},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"NRCan.geogratis-geogratis.RNCan@canada.ca","num_tags":0,"contributor":{},"frequency":"as_needed","keywords":{"fr":["canal","embarcation","industrie du transport maritime","navigation","navire","phare","transport maritime","voie navigable"],"en":["canals","lighthouses","navigation","ships","vessels","water transport","water transport industry","waterways"]},"data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"No. 22","en":"No. 22"},"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"67e18838-104b-55a8-96ab-b6b129030ceb","metadata_created":"2016-09-24T16:49:07.511655","subject":["economics_and_industry","government_and_politics","nature_and_environment","transport"],"spatial_representation_type":[],"metadata_modified":"2017-01-26T21:45:07.829508","author":null,"author_email":"NRCan.geogratis-geogratis.RNCan@canada.ca","geographic_region":[],"position_name":{},"portal_release_date":"2017-01-18","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"presentation_form":"map_hardcopy","relationships_as_object":[],"creator_user_id":"aa584ab4-544c-4c5c-81da-d1cff9bd96fa","title_translated":{"fr":"Canaux, phares et routes de navigation maritime - Saint-Laurent et Grands Lacs","en":"Canals, Lighthouses and Sailing Routes St. Lawrence and Great Lakes"},"type":"dataset","resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"67e18838-104b-55a8-96ab-b6b129030ceb","datastore_active":false,"id":"424ec346-6ea0-492b-8a01-6dbf0822cbc3","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Télécharger le fichier en format JPG via HTTP","en":"Download JPG through HTTP"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"JPG","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Download JPG through HTTP","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2017-01-26T16:45:08.424929","url":"http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_1_ed/eng/economic/transportationandcommunications/page22.jpg","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":0,"revision_id":"d3ea079c-e865-497d-8fdd-a9bf25295236","resource_type":"dataset"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"67e18838-104b-55a8-96ab-b6b129030ceb","datastore_active":false,"id":"5010b5bb-ae60-4a38-b33d-8f5bb2b55202","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Télécharger le fichier en format PDF via HTTP","en":"Download PDF through HTTP"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"PDF","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Download PDF through HTTP","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2017-01-26T16:45:08.424967","url":"http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_1_ed/eng/economic/transportationandcommunications/page22.pdf","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":1,"revision_id":"d3ea079c-e865-497d-8fdd-a9bf25295236","resource_type":"dataset"}],"place_of_publication":[],"metadata_contact":{},"num_resources":2,"topic_category":["boundaries","inland_waters","structure","transport"],"tags":[],"spatial":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-89.0, 49.0], [-89.0, 39.0], [-59.0, 39.0], [-59.0, 49.0], [-89.0, 49.0]]]}","collection":"geogratis","org_title_at_publication":{"fr":"Ressources naturelles Canada","en":"Natural Resources Canada"},"date_published":"1906-06-30 00:00:00","display_flags":[],"groups":[],"license_id":"ca-ogl-lgo","data_series_name":{"fr":"Atlas du Canada, 1e édition","en":"Atlas of Canada, 1st Edition"},"relationships_as_subject":[],"license_title":"Open Government Licence - Canada","restrictions":"unrestricted","organization":{"description":"","created":"2016-09-23T17:25:46.737130","title":"Natural Resources Canada | Ressources naturelles Canada","name":"nrcan-rncan","is_organization":true,"state":"active","image_url":"","revision_id":"a0c5bf0d-8541-443d-a8bf-b04a249733f4","type":"organization","id":"9391E0A2-9717-4755-B548-4499C21F917B","approval_status":"approved"},"name":"67e18838-104b-55a8-96ab-b6b129030ceb","isopen":false,"url":"{u'fr': u'http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/fr/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/67e18838-104b-55a8-96ab-b6b129030ceb', u'en': u'http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/67e18838-104b-55a8-96ab-b6b129030ceb'}","notes":"Contained within the 1st Edition (1906) of the Atlas of Canada is a map that shows canals, as well as locations and types of Lighthouses along the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes.
