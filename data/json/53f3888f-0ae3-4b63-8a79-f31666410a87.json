Au cours de l’exercice 2012 2013, le Ministère avait 55 contrats de services avec des professionnels de la santé, notamment des ergothérapeutes, des infirmières, des médecins et un dentiste, excluant ceux qui œuvrent à l’Hôpital Sainte-Anne.\r\n\r\nLa vérification avait pour objet de s’assurer que les activités ministérielles liées aux contrats de services conclus avec des professionnels de la santé sont menées conformément aux procédures d’ACC et aux politiques et règlements du Conseil du Trésor (CT). La vérification a également porté sur la gouvernance globale et sur la procédure de paiement. Les travaux sur le terrain ont été effectués d’avril à juillet 2013.\r\n","en":"Healthcare professional service contractors are individuals with “significant training, qualifications and expertise in a professional field.” With the support of Public Works and Government Services Canada, these contractors are used to obtain expert knowledge and to complement the existing workforce. \r\n\r\nAt Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), these healthcare professional service contractors review or conduct assessments of Veterans' health needs for services or benefits as well as provide consultation with VAC staff.
