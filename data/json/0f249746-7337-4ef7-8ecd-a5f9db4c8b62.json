{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Par l’entremise de son Programme d’établissement, Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada (IRCC) travaille avec de nombreux partenaires pour fournir des services aux nouveaux arrivants au Canada et soutenir leur intégration dans les collectivités canadiennes. Dans le cadre du Programme d’établissement, IRCC finance un large éventail de services dont les nouveaux arrivants bénéficient directement. Par ailleurs, le Programme d’établissement finance des services indirects qui visent à améliorer les connaissances et la capacité de la communauté de l’établissement financée par IRCC afin d’optimiser les résultats pour les nouveaux arrivants. Des initiatives spécialisées qui cherchent à répondre aux besoins particuliers des collectivités, des secteurs et des nouveaux arrivants viennent compléter le Programme d’établissement régulier.
