{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Le présent rapport est le fruit d'une évaluation des services de réadaptation menée conformément au Plan d'évaluation pluriannuel axé sur les risques 2013-2018 approuvé par Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC).\r\n\r\nDepuis l'entrée en vigueur, en 2006, de la Loi sur les mesures de réinsertion et d'indemnisation des militaires et vétérans des Forces canadiennes (appelée ci-après « la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants » ou « la NCAC »),  le Ministère met désormais l'accent sur le mieux-être plutôt que sur l'invalidité et concrétise l'engagement du Canada envers les membres et les vétérans blessés des Forces armées canadiennes (FAC). Le Programme de services de réadaptation et d'assistance professionnelle (appelé ci-après « le Programme »), qui fait partie de la NCAC, offre aux vétérans admissibles, ainsi qu'à leur conjoint et à leurs survivants, des services de réadaptation médicale, psychosociale et professionnelle. Au cours de l'exercice 2012-2013, des avantages et des services ont été financés pour 18,4 millions de dollars dans le cadre du Programme.\r\n\r\nLe Programme vise à faciliter le retour des participants à un degré de fonctionnement raisonnable dans les cinq grands domaines suivants : le fonctionnement mental et physique; l'adaptation sociale; les relations familiales; la sécurité financière, l'emploi et la productivité personnelle; et la participation à la vie de la collectivité. Les participants sont surtout des vétérans qui ont récemment été libérés des FAC pour des raisons médicales ou encore des vétérans des FAC qui souffrent d'un problème de santé, principalement attribuable à leur service militaire, les empêchant de réintégrer la vie civile. Souvent, les vétérans souffrent de troubles concomitants complexes nécessitant le recours aux divers avantages et services de réadaptation médicale et psychosociale offerts dans le cadre du Programme. \r\n\r\n\r\nL'évaluation a porté sur la pertinence et le rendement du Programme de services de réadaptation et d'assistance professionnelle, et elle a été menée conformément aux exigences du Conseil du Trésor et aux documents de référence du Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor. Les constatations et les conclusions découlant de l'évaluation sont fondées sur l'analyse de multiples sources de données.","en":"This Rehabilitation Services Evaluation was conducted in accordance with Veterans Affairs Canada's (VAC) approved Multi-year Risk Based Evaluation Plan 2013-2018.\r\n\r\nEstablished in 2006, the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-establishment and Compensation Act (hereinafter referred to as the New Veterans Charter or NVC), shifts the Department's focus from one of disability to one of wellness and responds to Canada's commitment to injured Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members and Veterans. As part of the NVC, the Rehabilitation Services and Vocational Assistance Program (hereinafter referred to as the Program) provides eligible Veteran recipients and their spouse/survivor(s) with one or more of the following types of rehabilitation services: medical, psychosocial, or vocational. In fiscal year 2012-13, the Program funded $18.4 million in benefits and services.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the Program is to support the reasonable restoration of functioning in the following five major areas: mental and physical functioning; social adjustment; family relationships; financial security, employment and personal productivity; and community participation. Recipients are primarily Veterans who were recently medically-released from the CAF, or CAF Veterans who have a health problem resulting primarily from service which is creating a barrier to their re-establishment in civilian life. Veterans often present with complex co-morbid conditions which require the use of the various available medical and psychosocial rehabilitation benefits and services.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation examined the relevance and performance of the Rehabilitation Services and Vocational Assistance Program and was conducted in accordance with Treasury Board (TB) requirements and TB Secretariat guidance material.
