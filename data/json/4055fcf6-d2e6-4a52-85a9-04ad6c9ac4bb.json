{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Anciens Combattants Canada compte 60 points de service ou centres de responsabilité, y compris les bureaux régionaux et les bureaux de district qui offrent une vaste gamme de services et de programmes.  Les bureaux de district offrent un service direct relativement aux programmes et les bureaux régionaux offrent une orientation et une supervision fonctionnelles.  Les trois plus importants points de service sont les bureaux de district à Québec, à Halifax et à Edmonton qui, ensemble, servent près du tiers des participants au programme de réadaptation.  Les trois bureaux de district ont en moyenne trois équipes de services aux clients et une clientèle variée participant au programme.  \r\n\r\nLa présente vérification est la seconde de deux phases et elle a été menée à la demande de la haute direction dans le but d’évaluer les contrôles internes qui accompagnent les pouvoirs délégués et la pertinence du cadre de contrôle de la gestion et également pour déterminer les possibilités d’amélioration de l’efficacité.  La première phase de la vérification cyclique qui a été achevée en octobre 2010 portait sur les opérations au bureau de district de Québec.  Le site a été sélectionné parce qu’on y mettait à l’essai de nouveaux pouvoirs délégués.  L’équipe chargée de l’évaluation s’est servie des résultats de la vérification du bureau de Québec lors de la planification de la deuxième phase, qui visait les opérations aux bureaux de district d’Halifax et d’Edmonton. \r\n","en":"Veterans Affairs Canada has 60 points of service or responsibility centres, including regional and district offices that provide a wide range of services and programs.
