{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"En 2012, Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC) et Service Canada ont conclu une entente de partenariat selon laquelle Service Canada utiliserait son site Web, ses services en personne et ses services téléphoniques pour offrir des renseignements généraux sur les services et les avantages d’ACC aux personnes qui consultent le site Web de Service Canada, se rendent dans un centre de Service Canada ou appellent la ligne d’information sans frais d’ACC. De plus, Service Canada accepterait et examinerait les demandes présentées au titre du Programme de prestations d’invalidité et du Programme pour l’autonomie des anciens combattants (PAAC). L’intention du partenariat était d’offrir aux vétérans un accès élargi aux services d’ACC sur le Web, en personne ou au téléphone. En demandant à Service Canada de répondre aux demandes de renseignements généraux, ACC s’attendait à pouvoir recentrer ses efforts sur les cas plus complexes. L’établissement d’un partenariat visait également à accroître les points d’accès aux services d’ACC, particulièrement pour les résidents des zones rurales et éloignées. En outre, Service Canada utiliserait son expertise et son expérience de tous les programmes du gouvernement du Canada et regrouperait l’information d’ACC avec ceux d’une gamme plus vaste de programmes et de services connexes du gouvernement du Canada.\r\n\r\nEn février 2014, le partenariat a été élargi pour y inclure des services d’hébergement des employés grâce auxquels Service Canada offrirait des locaux à bureaux et des salles de réunions pour qu’un représentant d’ACC travaille dans le centre de Service Canada le plus proche de chacun des bureaux de secteur d’ACC qui allaient être fermés.\r\n\r\nDans le cadre de l’approbation du partenariat, une évaluation devait être faite pour savoir si les normes applicables de service aux vétérans s’étaient améliorées, si les ressources avaient effectivement été recentrées sur l’amélioration de la gestion de cas et s’il y avait eu des gains d’efficacité qui pourraient se traduire par des économies opérationnelles à long terme sans réduction du niveau de service aux vétérans. L’évaluation permettrait également de déterminer si l’entente conclue entre ACC et Service Canada était respectée et de cerner tout point à améliorer.","en":"In 2012, Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) and Service Canada entered into a Partnership whereby Service Canada would use their web, in-person and telephone services to provide general information on VAC’s benefits and services to individuals who visit Service Canada’s website, visit a Service Canada Centre or call VAC’s toll-free line. In addition, Service Canada would accept and review applications for the Disability Benefits Program and the Veterans Independence Program (VIP). The intention of the Partnership was that Veterans would have broader access to VAC’s services on the web, in-person and on the phone. By having Service Canada answer general inquiries on VAC’s behalf, it was expected that VAC would be able to re-focus their resources on more complex cases. The Partnership was also intended to increase points of access for VAC Services, particularly for residents in rural and remote areas. In addition, Service Canada would use their expertise and experience with all Government of Canada programs and bundle VAC’s information with a broader array of related Government of Canada programs and services. \r\n\r\nIn February 2014 the Partnership was expanded to include employee hosting services, whereby Service Canada would provide office and meeting space for a VAC representative to be co-located in the Service Canada Centre closest to each of the VAC area offices that were closing.\r\n\r\nAs part of the approval of the Partnership, an evaluation was required which would assess whether applicable service standards for Veterans had improved, whether resources were effectively refocused on improving case management and if efficiencies had materialized that could provide longer term operational savings without reducing the level of service to Veterans. The evaluation would also determine if there was compliance with the documented agreement between VAC and Service Canada, and identify any areas for improvement."},"issn":"","imso_approval":"true","isbn":"","creator":"","org_section":{"fr":"","en":""},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"vac.opengovernment-gouvernementouvert.acc@canada.ca","num_tags":0,"edition":"","frequency":"not_planned","data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"","en":""},"contributor":{"fr":"","en":""},"maintainer":null,"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"7e8eab73-a760-459e-af34-35d75578b884","metadata_created":"2017-07-04T19:51:45.806543","subject":["government_and_politics"],"pspc_identification_number":"","metadata_modified":"2019-01-05T14:50:22.605208","author":null,"author_email":null,"geographic_region":[],"portal_release_date":"2017-07-04","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"keywords":{"fr":["Anciens Combattants Canada","ACC","Service Canada","Partenariat","Audit interne","Évaluation","Vétérans"],"en":["Veterans Affairs Canada","VAC","Service Canada","Partnership","Internal Auditing","Evaluation","Veterans"]},"relationships_as_object":[],"creator_user_id":"aa584ab4-544c-4c5c-81da-d1cff9bd96fa","title_translated":{"fr":"Anciens Combattants Canada Évaluation du partenariat entre Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC) et Service Canada -
