{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La Loi sur les mesures de réinsertion et d’indemnisation des militaires et vétérans des Forces canadiennes (la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants) est entrée en vigueur le 1er avril 2006. La Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants (NCAC) vise à donner aux vétérans des Forces canadiennes (FC) et à leurs familles accès aux services et aux programmes qui satisfont à leurs besoins individuels. La gamme des programmes offerts comprend la réadaptation, les avantages financiers, une assurance-maladie de groupe, des services de transition de carrière, l’indemnité d’invalidité et le soutien aux familles. \r\n\r\nL’évaluation a été menée du 1er avril 2009 au 29 octobre 2010 et comptait trois phases. La phase I portait sur la pertinence et la raison d’être de la NCAC et de ses programmes. La phase II portait sur les activités de sensibilisation, le processus de présentation d’une demande et le cadre de prestation des services. La phase III portait sur l’atteinte des résultats attendus. Les constatations tirées de ces études guideront l’amélioration de l’élaboration et de la prestation des programmes de la NCAC et permettront de tenir l’engagement pris par le Ministère en réponse au Conseil du Trésor (CT). De plus, une évaluation distincte comparant le programme des indemnités d’invalidité au programme de pensions d’invalidité a été réalisée en parallèle avec l’évaluation de la NCAC et a été achevée en août 2010.\r\n","en":"On April 1, 2006, the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-establishment and Compensation Act (the New Veterans Charter) came into force. The New Veterans Charter (NVC) was designed to give Canadian Forces (CF) Veterans and their families access to services and programs that would meet their individual needs. The suite of programs includes: rehabilitation; financial benefits; group health insurance; career transition services; disability award; and support to families. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation was conducted from April 1, 2009 until October 29, 2010 and consisted of three phases. Phase I focussed on the relevance and rationale of the NVC and its programs. Phase II focussed on outreach, the application process and service delivery framework. Phase III focussed on the success in achieving desired outcomes. The findings from these studies are intended to improve the design and delivery of the NVC programs, and will fulfill a departmental commitment to Treasury Board (TB). Additionally, a separate evaluation comparing the Disability Award (DA) Program to the Disability Pension (DP) Program was conducted concurrently with the NVC evaluation, and was finalized in August 2010. \r\n"},"issn":"","imso_approval":"true","isbn":"","creator":"","org_section":{"fr":"","en":""},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"vac.opengovernment-gouvernementouvert.acc@canada.ca","num_tags":0,"edition":"","frequency":"not_planned","data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"","en":""},"contributor":{"fr":"","en":""},"maintainer":null,"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"0e471f99-f988-40f0-a9dd-529c1f62a599","metadata_created":"2017-08-04T13:20:18.723402","subject":["government_and_politics"],"pspc_identification_number":"","metadata_modified":"2019-01-05T14:10:33.872743","author":null,"author_email":null,"geographic_region":[],"portal_release_date":"2017-08-04","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"keywords":{"fr":["Anciens Combattants Canada","ACC","Audit interne","Évaluation","Vétérans","Nouvelle charte des anciens combattants","NCAA"],"en":["Veterans Affairs Canada","Internal auditing","Evaluation","Veterans","New Veterans Charter","NVC"]},"relationships_as_object":[],"creator_user_id":"aa584ab4-544c-4c5c-81da-d1cff9bd96fa","title_translated":{"fr":"Anciens Combattants Canada Évaluation de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants – Phase III -
