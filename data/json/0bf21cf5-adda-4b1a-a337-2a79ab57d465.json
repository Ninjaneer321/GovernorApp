{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Entreprise à forte croissance - D'après la liste de l'ensemble des entreprises canadiennes qui figurent dans le Registre des entreprises de Statistique Canada, une entreprise à forte croissance est une entreprise dont la croissance moyenne annualisée du chiffre d'affaires est supérieure à 20 % par année sur une période de trois ans. Ainsi, la croissance totale sur une période de trois ans doit être supérieure à 72,8 %. Pour les besoins de cet indicateur, la croissance est mesurée à partir du chiffre d'affaires (mais elle peut aussi l'être à partir du nombre d'emplois). Une entreprise à forte croissance doit compter au moins 10 employés au début de la période de trois ans et exister depuis au moins quatre ans.","en":"High-Growth Firm – Based on list of all businesses in Canada included in Statistics Canada’s Business Register, a “high-growth firm” is an enterprise with average annualized growth greater than 20% per annum over a three-year period. That is, the total growth over a three-year period must be greater than 72.8%. For this indicator, growth has been measured by revenue (though it can also be measured by growth in employment).
