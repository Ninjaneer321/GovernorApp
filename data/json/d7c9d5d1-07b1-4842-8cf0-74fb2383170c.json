{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Avoir recours à la cryptographie est un moyen efficace d’assurer la confidentialité et l’intégrité de l’information et de protéger les systèmes de TI contre les auteurs de cybermenace. L’informatique quantique menace de craquer la plupart des mécanismes cryptographiques que nous employons actuellement. Les ordinateurs quantiques utiliseront la physique quantique pour traiter l’information avec efficience et arriveront à solutionner des problèmes qu’il est difficile de résoudre au moyen des capacités de traitement actuelles. Les ordinateurs que l’on peut acheter aujourd’hui n’ont pas la puissance nécessaire pour venir à bout des techniques de cryptographie, mais la technologie évolue rapidement et pourrait être accessible d’ici 2030. Dans un jour prochain, un auteur de menace pourrait disposer d’un ordinateur quantique suffisamment puissant pour déchiffrer, lire ou consulter l’information sensible, et ce, bien après qu’elle a été créée.\r\n","en":"Cryptography is an effective way to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information and to protect IT systems from cyber threat actors.
