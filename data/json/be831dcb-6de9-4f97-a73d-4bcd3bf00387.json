Savez-vous de quelle façon les fournisseurs traitent votre information et celle de vos clients, ou encore où cette information est enregistrée ? Vous avez tout intérêt à poser ces questions et d’autres questions afin de protéger votre organisation. Tout comme les grandes organisations, les petites et moyennes organisations sont vulnérables aux cyberattaques parce qu’ils possèdent beaucoup d’information de nature délicate qui attire les auteurs de menace. En plus d’être coûteuses à éradiquer, les cybermenaces peuvent mettre en péril votre organisation.\r\n\r\nUne chaîne d’approvisionnement est le lien essentiel entre votre organisation et les autres organisations qui vous aident à servir vos clients. Que vous soyez propriétaire d’une boutique de fleurs ou d’une agence de publicité, la réussite de votre organisation dépend de la qualité et de la sécurité de votre chaîne d’approvisionnement.\"\r\n","en":"\"As an organization owner, have you ever paused to think about the kind of information you share with your supply chain?
