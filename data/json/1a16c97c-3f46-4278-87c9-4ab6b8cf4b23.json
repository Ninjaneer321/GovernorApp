{"issuance_frequency":"irregular","notes_translated":{"fr":"Un réseau privé virtuel (RPV) est une connexion sécurisée entre deux points, comme un ordinateur portable et le réseau d’une organisation. Le RPV sert de tunnel par l’entremise duquel on peut envoyer et recevoir des données sécurisées dans un réseau physique existant. Par exemple, un employé en télétravail pourra utiliser un RPV pour envoyer des données qui seront chiffrées jusqu’à leur destination (comme un serveur dans le lieu de travail, télétravailleur). Nous présentons ici quelques risques et facteurs dont il faut tenir compte avant d’utiliser des services RPV.","en":"A virtual private network (VPN) is a secure connection between two points, such as your laptop and your organization’s network.
