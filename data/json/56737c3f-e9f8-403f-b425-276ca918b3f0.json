{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Ce rapport fait suite à une enquête menée par le Commissariat au lobbying (CAL), conformément à l’article 10.4 de la Loi sur le lobbying (Loi), pour déterminer si M. David MacNaughton, ancien ambassadeur du Canada aux États-Unis et actuel président de Palantir Canada, a contrevenu à l’interdiction quinquennale d’après-mandat énoncée à l’alinéa 10.11(1)c) de la Loi. Cette disposition interdit aux anciens titulaires d’une charge publique désignée de se livrer à des activités de lobbying à titre de lobbyiste salarié à l’emploi de personnes morales si de telles activités représenteraient une partie importante des activités au nom de leur employeur.\r\n\r\nÀ la lumière de tous les renseignements recueillis, j’ai conclu que M. MacNaughton n’a pas contrevenu à la restriction relative au lobbying à laquelle il est assujetti en tant qu’ancien titulaire d’une charge publique désignée à l’emploi d’une personne morale.\r\n\r\nAfin de prendre cette décision, le CAL devait déterminer si M. MacNaughton avait communiqué avec des titulaires d’une charge publique fédérale au nom de Palantir à propos de l’un ou l’autre des objets mentionnés à l’alinéa 7(1)a) de la Loi et, le cas échéant, si de telles activités de lobbying menées à titre de lobbyiste salarié constituaient une partie importante des activités qu’il exerce au nom de Palantir.","en":"This report follows an investigation conducted by the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying (OCL) pursuant to section 10.4 of the Lobbying Act (Act) to determine whether Mr. David MacNaughton, former Canadian Ambassador to the United States and current President of Palantir Canada, contravened the five-year restriction on lobbying set out in paragraph 10.11(1)(c) of the Act.
