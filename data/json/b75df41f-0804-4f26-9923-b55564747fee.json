On entend par « entièrement vacciné » le fait d’avoir reçu la série complète de doses d’un vaccin approuvé par le gouvernement du Canada, ou une combinaison de vaccins jugés acceptables, au moins 14 jours avant l’arrivée au pays. Votre statut vaccinal sera validé chaque fois que vous entrerez au Canada.","en":"The Government of Canada has put in place emergency measures under the Quarantine Act to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 and variants in Canada.
