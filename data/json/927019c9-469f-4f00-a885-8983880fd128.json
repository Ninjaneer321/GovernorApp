{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Le système de surveillance de FoodNet Canada, de l’Agence de la santé publique du Canada, a le plaisir de vous présenter le plus récent rapport annuel qui décrit les résultats des activités de surveillance que nous avons effectuées en 2017. Le rapport souligne les données obtenues par FoodNet Canada dans ses sites sentinelles de la Colombie-Britannique, de l’Alberta et de l’Ontario. Il met l’accent sur les tendances des taux liés aux maladies causées par des entéropathogènes ainsi que les tendances de la prévalence de ces pathogènes parmi les sources d’infection potentielles : les viandes vendues au détail, le fumier des animaux destinés à la consommation et l’eau. Nous soulignons également l’impact des tendances relatives aux entéropathogènes sur la santé publique.","en":"The Public Health Agency of Canada’s FoodNet Canada surveillance system is pleased to present the latest annual report which outlines the results of our surveillance activities conducted in 2017.
