{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Le nombre de plongeon huard ainsi que son aire de reproduction ont beaucoup diminué depuis le début du siècle. Le nombre de couples reproducteurs ainsi que le nombre de jeunes qui atteignent l’âge de l’envol est préoccupant. Afin d’établir l'état de la population dans l'ensemble du parc national de La Mauricie, les huards sont suivis via deux inventaires aériens réalisés sur tous les lacs du parc de plus de 3 hectares ainsi que via le parcours en canot des lacs les plus accessibles afin de confirmer la présence de huard et de localiser leurs nids.","en":"The number of common loons and their breeding range have decreased significantly since the beginning of the century.
