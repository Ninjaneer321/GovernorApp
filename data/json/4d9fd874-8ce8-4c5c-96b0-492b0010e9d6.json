Il présente au Parlement de l'information sur les besoins en matière de dépenses du gouvernement du Canada qui n'étaient pas suffisamment élaborées au moment du dépôt du budget principal des dépenses, et de temps à autres, il inclue des dépenses urgentes mais imprévues comme les dépenses engagées en cas de catastrophes naturelles (p. ex., une tempête de verglas et H1N1). Le budget supplémentaire des dépenses appuie directement une loi de crédits. Le budget supplémentaire des dépenses es t publié au cours de l'exercice. Chaque publication est désignée en ordre alphabétique (A, B, C, etc.) Le budget supplémentaire des dépenses (A) est déposé en mai, et la loi de crédits qui s'y rattache reçoit la sanction royale et devient loi en juin. Il fournit aux organis ations fédérales les fonds dont elles ont besoin au début de l'année. Le budget supplémentaire des dépenses (B) est déposé à la fin octobre ou au début de novembre, et la loi de crédits qui s'y rattache reçoit la sanction royale en décembre.
