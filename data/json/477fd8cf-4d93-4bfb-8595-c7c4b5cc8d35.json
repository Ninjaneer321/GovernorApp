Les dispositifs mobiles jouent un rôle essentiel dans les activités quotidiennes des organisations et des organismes, mais leur utilisation représente aussi une menace pour l’information et les réseaux.\r\n\r\nComme ils peuvent contenir d’énormes quantités de données sensibles et de renseignements personnels, les dispositifs mobiles sont une cible alléchante pour les auteurs de menaces qui cherchent à recueillir de l’information. Un dispositif compromis peut fournir un accès non autorisé au réseau de votre organisation, ce qui menace à la fois la sécurité de votre information et de celle de votre organisation.\r\n\r\nEt il ne faut pas oublier que le Canada est une cible attrayante pour les auteurs de cybermenaces en raison de sa richesse, de ses ressources et de ses relations diplomatiques.\"\r\n","en":"\"Your mobile device provides a convenient and flexible way to work anywhere or at anytime.
