{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Cet audit visait à déterminer si l’Agence des services frontaliers du Canada avait renvoyé dès que possible les étrangers interdits de territoire au Canada. Nous avons aussi examiné la coordination de l’échange d’information entre la Commission de l’immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada, un tribunal indépendant, et Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada, qui aide l’Agence à surveiller et à exécuter les mesures de renvoi. L’Agence n’a cependant aucune maîtrise sur diverses circonstances pouvant retarder l’exécution des mesures de renvoi. Dans le cadre de nos travaux d’audit, nous avons tenu compte de ces retards et axé nos efforts sur le traitement des mesures de renvoi pendant qu’elles étaient exécutoires et sous le contrôle de l’Agence.","en":"This audit focused on whether the Canada Border Services Agency removed individuals ordered to leave Canada as soon as possible. We also examined the coordination of information shared by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, an independent tribunal, and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, which supports the agency’s monitoring and enforcement of removal orders. Various case circumstances are outside the agency’s control and can delay removal. Our audit work accounted for these delays and focused on the processing of removal orders while they were enforceable and under the agency’s
