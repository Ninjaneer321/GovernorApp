{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La ministre de la Justice a examiné le projet de loi afin de déterminer sa conformité au regard de la Constitution, incluant au regard de la Charte au terme de ses obligations prévues à l’article 4.1 de la Loi sur le ministère de la Justice. L’examen effectué a pris en considération, entre autres, les objectifs et caractéristiques du projet de loi tels que décrits ci-haut dans la Partie 1; la preuve fournie par les sciences sociales et les rapports législatifs, gouvernementaux et de consultations aussi décrits dans la Partie 1; la preuve liée aux approches et expériences des autres pays et États en matière d’aide médicale à mourir telle qu’énoncée dans les parties 2 et 3; et les avis et constats des tribunaux dans Carter, incluant la Cour suprême du Canada.\r\n\r\nLa liste non exhaustive ci-après des répercussions possibles sur les droits et libertés garantis par la Charte est présentée afin de contribuer aux débats publics et parlementaires, et conséquemment, afin de faciliter le dialogue entre le législateur et les tribunaux. De plus, la ministre de la Justice a déposé un addendum au présent Contexte législatif à la Chambre des communes et l’a publié sur le site Web du ministère de la Justice. La présente partie du Contexte législatif devrait donc être lue de pair avec l’addendum, qui explique la posititon du gouvernement quant à la constitutionalité du projet de loi C-14 et la justification de l’approche adoptée dans le projet de loi.","en":"The Minister has reviewed Bill C-14 for compliance with the Constitution, including the Charter in accordance with her obligations under section 4.1 of the Department of Justice Act. This review is included consideration of, amongst other thing, the objectives and features of the Bill as described above in PArt 1, the social science evidence and legislative, governmental and consultative reports referred to in Part 1, the evidence of other jurisdictions' approaches to and experiences with medical assistance in dying discussed in Part 2 and 3, and the views and findings of the courts in Carter, including the Supreme Court of Canada. \r\n\r\nThe following non-exhaustive list of potential impacts on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the charter is presented to assist in informing the public and Parliamentary debate, and consequently better enable dialogue between Parliament and the courts. In addition, the Minister of Justice tabled an addendum to this Legislative Background in the House of Commons and published it on the Department of Justice website. This Part of the Legislative Background should, therefore, be read together with the Addendum, which provides an explanation of the government's position on the constitutionality of the new legislation, as well as the rationale for the approach in Bill C-14.
