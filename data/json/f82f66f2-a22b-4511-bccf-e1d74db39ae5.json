{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Cette liste exclut tous les noms personnels, tels que les employeurs des aides-familiaux ou les noms d'entreprises qui incluent des noms personnels. Pour cette raison, cette liste est incomplète et ne contient pas tous les employeurs qui ont soumis ou obtenu une EIMT.\r\n\r\nLes données contenues dans ce rapport couvrent seulement les postes de Travailleurs étrangers temporaires (TET) qui ont fait l’objet d’une étude d’impact sur le marché du travail (EIMT) négative, ce qui signifie que l’employeur n’a pas rencontré toutes les exigences du PTET.\r\n\r\nDans l’ensemble, s’il ressort d’une étude que l’embauche d’un TET n’aura pas un effet positif ou neutre sur le marché du travail canadien, une EIMT négative sera émise. Parmi les raisons précises qui donnent lieu à une étude négative, mentionnons les suivantes :\r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur n’a pu démontrer qu’il a un besoin raisonnable en matière d’emploi;\r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur n’a pu démontrer qu’il a fait des efforts suffisants pour combler le poste vacant en recrutant, embauchant ou formant des Canadiens ou des résidents permanents;\r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur n’a pas offert un salaire conforme à celui établi pour la profession visée; \r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur ne respecte pas les accords ou les règlements fédéraux, provinciaux ou territoriaux\r\n\r\n•\til y a des preuves que l’entrée au pays d’un ressortissant étranger aurait des répercussions sur un conflit de travail en suspens qui concerne des Canadiens dans la profession visée;\r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur n’a pu démontrer sa capacité à respecter les modalités de l’offre d’emploi;\r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur n’a pu démontrer qu’il exploite activement une entreprise dans le secteur visé par l’offre d’emploi;\r\n\r\n•\tl’employeur ne s’est pas conformé aux exigences ou aux conditions établies dans des EIMT confirmées ou des annexes précédentes.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nÀ compter de février 2018, le Système des travailleurs étrangers de collecte de donnée d'Emploi et Développement social Canada (EDSC) est devenu le système d'EIMT.\r\nTous EIMT en appui à la résidence permanente (RP) sont exclues des rapports statistiques du PTÉT, sauf lorsque distinguées séparément. Ceci pourrait affecter les statistiques rapportées au fil du temps.\r\nLes informations sur le pays de citoyenneté ont été remplacées par les informations sur le pays de résidence, reflétant les politiques actuelles de collecte de données du système d’EIMT.\r\n\r\nSi un employeur souhaite communiquer avec Emploi et Développement social Canada concernant ces informations, prière de communiquer au NA-TFWP-PTET@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.","en":"This list excludes all personal names, such as employers of caregivers or business names that use or include personal names. For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA.\r\n\r\nThe data provided in this report tracks temporary foreign worker (TFW) positions on negative Labour Market Impact Assessments, which means that the employer did not meet all of the TFWP requirements. \r\n\r\nOverall, if an assessment indicates that hiring a TFW will not have a positive or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market, a negative LMIA will be issued. Specific reasons for a negative assessment could include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n•the employer was not able to demonstrate a reasonable employment need; \r\n\r\n•the employer has not demonstrated sufficient efforts to recruit, hire or train Canadians or permanent residents for the position;\r\n\r\n•the employer did not offer a wage consistent with the occupation being requested; \r\n\r\n•the employer is not adhering to federal/provincial/territorial regulations and/or agreements;\r\n\r\n•there is evidence that the entry of a foreign national would impact a pending labour dispute involving Canadians in the requested occupation;\r\n\r\n•the employer was not able to demonstrate the ability to fulfil the terms of the job offer;\r\n\r\n•the employer was not able to demonstrate that they are actively engaged in the business related to the job offer; and/or\r\n\r\n•the employer did not comply with the requirements or conditions set out in previous positive LMIAs and annexes.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nEffective February 2018, Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) Foreign Worker System changed to the LMIA System.\r\nLMIAs in support of Permanent Residence (PR) are excluded from TFWP statistics reporting, unless reported separately. This may impact statistics reported over time.\r\nCountry of citizenship information are replaced with country of residence information, reflecting current data collection policies of the LMIA

For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA.\r\n\r\nThe data provided in this report tracks temporary foreign worker (TFW) positions on negative Labour Market Impact Assessments, which means that the employer did not meet all of the TFWP requirements. \r\n\r\nOverall, if an assessment indicates that hiring a TFW will not have a positive or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market, a negative LMIA will be issued. Specific reasons for a negative assessment could include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n•the employer was not able to demonstrate a reasonable employment need; \r\n\r\n•the employer has not demonstrated sufficient efforts to recruit, hire or train Canadians or permanent residents for the position;\r\n\r\n•the employer did not offer a wage consistent with the occupation being requested; \r\n\r\n•the employer is not adhering to federal/provincial/territorial regulations and/or agreements;\r\n\r\n•there is evidence that the entry of a foreign national would impact a pending labour dispute involving Canadians in the requested occupation;\r\n\r\n•the employer was not able to demonstrate the ability to fulfil the terms of the job offer;\r\n\r\n•the employer was not able to demonstrate that they are actively engaged in the business related to the job offer; and/or\r\n\r\n•the employer did not comply with the requirements or conditions set out in previous positive LMIAs and annexes.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nEffective February 2018, Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) Foreign Worker System changed to the LMIA System.\r\nLMIAs in support of Permanent Residence (PR) are excluded from TFWP statistics reporting, unless reported separately. This may impact statistics reported over time.\r\nCountry of citizenship information are replaced with country of residence information, reflecting current data collection policies of the LMIA System.\r\n\r\nShould an employer wish to contact Employment and Social Development Canada concerning this information, please contact NA-TFWP-PTET@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.","owner_org":"055ADCD8-8FDA-40DA-A5B7-689FF7DB57A6","audience":[],"license_url":"http://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada","program_page_url":{"fr":"","en":""},"title":"Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP): Negative Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) Employers List","revision_id":"a716bbd1-5581-45f4-80e5-553dadf5aad4"}
