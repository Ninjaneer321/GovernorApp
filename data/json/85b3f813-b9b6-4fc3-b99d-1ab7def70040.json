{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"L’équipe d’évaluation a examiné les services d’informatique répartie (SIR) fournis par Services partagés Canada (SPC) à un groupe d’organisations clientes selon un principe de recouvrement des coûts. Les SIR englobent un éventail de services qui soutiennent la fourniture et le fonctionnement des postes de travail et des environnements informatiques des employés, tels que les services techniques des ordinateurs de bureau, leur déploiement et un soutien technique continu. Le travail de SPC visant à consolider l’approvisionnement de logiciels et de matériel à l’échelle du gouvernement fédéral a été exclu de l’évaluation.  Conformément à la Politique sur l’évaluation du Conseil du Trésor, la présente évaluation vise à déterminer la pertinence et le rendement des SIR. Elle ciblait plus particulièrement l’évaluation du rendement et l’identification de facteurs qui influent sur l’atteinte des résultats en matière de service. \r\n","en":"The evaluation team examined Distributed Computing Services (DCS) provided by Shared Services Canada (SSC) to a group of client organizations on a cost-recovery basis. DCS encompass a range of services that support the provisioning and functionality of employee workstations and computing environments, such as desktop engineering, deployment and ongoing technical support. SSC’s work in consolidating government-wide procurement of software and hardware was excluded from the evaluation.  The objective of this evaluation, as per the Treasury Board Policy on Evaluation, was to determine the relevance and performance of DCS. The objective was further refined to focus on assessing performance and identifying factors that affect the achievement of service outcomes. \r\n"},"issn":"","imso_approval":"true","isbn":"","creator":"","org_section":{"fr":"","en":""},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca","num_tags":0,"edition":"","frequency":"unknown","data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"","en":""},"contributor":{"fr":"","en":""},"maintainer":null,"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"85b3f813-b9b6-4fc3-b99d-1ab7def70040","metadata_created":"2019-08-07T17:29:59.720311","subject":["government_and_politics"],"pspc_identification_number":"","metadata_modified":"2019-08-07T17:29:59.720321","author":null,"author_email":null,"geographic_region":[],"portal_release_date":"2019-08-07","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"keywords":{"fr":["audit","services d’informatique répartie"],"en":["Audit","Distributed Computing Services"]},"relationships_as_object":[],"creator_user_id":"4cfa9a9c-1d95-40eb-86f9-bc0c8ec45d1f","title_translated":{"fr":"Évaluation des services d’informatique répartie","en":"Evaluation of Distributed Computing Services"},"type":"info","resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"unique_identifier":"","package_id":"85b3f813-b9b6-4fc3-b99d-1ab7def70040","datastore_active":false,"character_set":"","related_type":"","state":"active","id":"ba7c78c5-aa7c-48f0-8d48-ddd868fca0d8","related_relationship":"","name_translated":{"fr":"Évaluation des services d’informatique répartie","en":"Evaluation of Distributed Computing Services"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"HTML","date_published":"","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Evaluation of Distributed Computing Services","language":["en"],"created":"2019-08-07T17:30:00.553585","url":"https://www.canada.ca/en/shared-services/corporate/publications/evaluation-distributed-computing-services.html","last_modified":null,"position":0,"revision_id":"19a3b13c-2a2f-464d-9219-6324f42e9a1b","resource_type":"audit"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"unique_identifier":"","package_id":"85b3f813-b9b6-4fc3-b99d-1ab7def70040","datastore_active":false,"character_set":"","related_type":"","state":"active","id":"14a3594b-408c-4722-8419-7f66c12c3bf2","related_relationship":"","name_translated":{"fr":"Évaluation des services d’informatique répartie","en":"Evaluation of Distributed Computing Services"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"HTML","date_published":"","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Evaluation of Distributed Computing Services","language":["fr"],"created":"2019-08-07T17:30:00.553594","url":"https://www.canada.ca/fr/services-partages/organisation/publications/evaluation-services-informatique-repartie.html","last_modified":null,"position":1,"revision_id":"19a3b13c-2a2f-464d-9219-6324f42e9a1b","resource_type":"audit"}],"place_of_publication":[],"num_resources":2,"tags":[],"spatial":"","collection":"publication","org_title_at_publication":{"fr":"Services partagés Canada","en":"Shared Services Canada"},"date_published":"2017-08-01 00:00:00","issuance":"","groups":[],"license_id":"ca-ogl-lgo","data_series_name":{"fr":"","en":""},"relationships_as_subject":[],"license_title":"Open Government Licence - Canada","restrictions":"unrestricted","organization":{"description":"","created":"2016-09-23T17:26:13.947303","title":"Shared Services Canada | Services partagés Canada","name":"ssc-spc","is_organization":true,"state":"active","image_url":"","revision_id":"e5afff65-626c-473e-90f5-4872ecb07312","type":"organization","id":"a793f17d-6bcd-47dd-97fe-f00835fb4a0d","approval_status":"approved"},"name":"85b3f813-b9b6-4fc3-b99d-1ab7def70040","isopen":false,"additional_notes":{"fr":"","en":""},"departmental_identification_number":"","notes":"The evaluation team examined Distributed Computing Services (DCS) provided by Shared Services Canada (SSC) to a group of client organizations on a cost-recovery basis.
