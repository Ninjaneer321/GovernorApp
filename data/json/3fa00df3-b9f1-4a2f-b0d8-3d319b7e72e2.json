{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"L'Enquête sur la couverture vaccinale contre la COVID-19 (ECVCC) cible tous les Canadiens adultes vivant dans les 10 provinces et les capitales des 3 territoires, sauf ceux qui vivent : dans des établissements ou des logements collectifs ; en réserve.  L'objectif de l'enquête est de mesurer la couverture vaccinale contre la COVID-19 au Canada et dans les provinces et les territoires. L'enquête compare les niveaux de couverture vaccinale selon différents sous-groupes sociodémographiques. Cette enquête aide également à : découvrir pourquoi certaines personnes choisissent de ne pas se faire vacciner; déterminer si les personnes qui ne sont pas encore vaccinées contre la COVID-19 prévoient se faire vacciner ; en apprendre davantage sur les connaissances, les attitudes et les croyances des gens au sujet des vaccins contre la COVID-19 et des vaccins en général ; en apprendre davantage sur les sources d'information fiables sur les vaccins contre la COVID-19 afin d'éclairer les efforts de communication. Nos estimations les plus fiables de la couverture vaccinale sont celles fondées sur les registres provinciaux et territoriaux. L'ECVCC complète ce système en collectant des renseignements supplémentaires. L’ECVCC est composée de plusieurs cycles. Le premier cycle a eu lieu dans les capitales des territoires. Le deuxième cycle s’est déroulé dans les 10 provinces. D’autres cycles ciblant les adultes vivant dans les provinces pourraient être réalisés prochainement. La période de collecte pour un cycle est d'environ 4 semaines.","en":"The COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Survey (CVCS) targets all Canadian adults living in the 10 provinces and the capital cities of the 3 territories, except those who live: in institutions or collective dwellings; on-reserve. The purpose of the survey is to measure COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Canada and the provinces and territories. The survey compares vaccination coverage levels by different socio-demographic subgroups. This survey also helps to: find out why some people choose not to get vaccinated; find out if people who are not yet vaccinated against COVID-19 plan to get vaccinated; learn more about people's knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general; learn more about trusted sources of information related to COVID-19 vaccines to inform communication efforts. Our most reliable vaccination coverage estimates are those based on provincial and territorial registries. The CVCS complements this system with additional information. The CVCS has multiple cycles. The first cycle was conducted in the capital cities of the territories. The second cycle was conducted in the 10 provinces. More cycles targeting adults living in the provinces may be carried out in the future. The collection period for a cycle is approximately 4
