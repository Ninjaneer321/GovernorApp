{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"En majorité, les Canadiens aimeraient qu’on accorde aux juges un certain pouvoir discrétionnaire et de la souplesse en matière de détermination de la peine.\r\n\r\nLes autres constats: \r\n\r\nLa vaste majorité des Canadiens (95 %) estiment que pour en arriver à des peines justes et appropriées pour les délinquants, il faut accorder au moins un certain pouvoir discrétionnaire aux juges. Pour 7 Canadiens sur 10 (71 %), la meilleure approche consiste à donner aux juges une forme quelconque de lignes directrices ou une gamme de peines possibles, tout en leur permettant de s’écarter de cette gamme s’ils estiment que c’est indiqué. Selon le quart environ (24 %) des Canadiens, le mieux pour obtenir des peines justes et appropriées serait de donner aux juges un plein pouvoir discrétionnaire (lesquels détermineraient la peine en tenant compte de la manière dont l’infraction a été commise, du motif du délinquant et des peines qui ont été infligées dans des affaires semblables). Seulement 4 % pensent que les juges ne doivent avoir aucun pouvoir discrétionnaire en matière de détermination de la peine (ces personnes adhèrent au principe « à infraction égale, peine égale », sans égard à l’auteur).\r\n\r\nLe but premier du système de justice pénale (SJP), selon les Canadiens, est d’assurer que tous sont traités justement, et que leur situation personnelle est prise en compte (40 % des répondants ont choisi ce but parmi les 3 buts prioritaires du SJP).","en":"The majority of Canadians believe that judges should have at least some degree of discretion and flexibility when deciding a sentence.\r\n\r\nWhat we also found: \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of Canadians (95%) felt that the best approach for determining fair and appropriate sentences for offenders involves giving judges at least some degree of discretion.

About one-quarter (24%) of Canadians believed that the best way to determine a fair and appropriate sentence was to give judges full discretion (deciding on the sentence after looking at how the offence happened, why the offender did it and what sentences were given in other similar cases).
