{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Nous publions chaque année les projections des émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) et de polluants atmosphériques du Canada.\r\n\r\nLes projections d'émissions de GES nous aident à mesurer les progrès accomplis dans la réduction des émissions de GES et la lutte contre les changements climatiques. Les projections des émissions de GES sont présentées selon quelques scénarios. Les projections des polluants atmosphériques témoignent des mesures que nous prenons pour réduire la pollution atmosphérique. \r\n\r\nDescription du contenu du site :\r\n============================\r\n\r\nEn raison du grand nombre de tableaux, les résultats sont présentés dans des dossiers et des sous-dossiers. Vous trouverez ci-dessous une description de la structure des dossiers:\r\n\r\n• current_projections_actuelles: Ce dossier contient nos projections les plus récentes telles que rapportées dans l'édition 2020 des Projections des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et polluants atmosphériques (https://www.canada.ca/fr/environnement-changement-climatique/services/changements-climatiques/emissions-gaz-effet-serre/projections.html).\r\n\r\n• previous_projections_precedentes: Ce dossier contient des projections initialement rapportées en 2017, 2018 et 2019 (des liens à ces rapports sont fournis sur notre page sur les projections des émissions de gaz à effet de serre à l'adresse suivante : https://www.canada.ca/fr/environnement-changement-climatique/services/changements-climatiques/emissions-gaz-effet-serre/projections.html).\r\n\r\nÀ partir de 2018, les résultats sont présentés dans deux sous-dossiers supplémentaires. Chacun comprend un fichier nommé readme_lisezmoi.txt, qui fournit des détails supplémentaires sur les données incluses dans chaque sous-dossier.\r\n\r\n• Le sous-dossier \"GHG - GES\" comprend des tableaux présentant les données sur les émissions de GES.\r\n\r\n• Le sous-dossier \"Energy - Énergie\" contient des tableaux présentant les données énergétiques et macroéconomiques pour chacun des secteurs inclus dans le dossier \"GHG - GES\".","en":"We publish Canada’s greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions projections each year. \r\n\r\nThe GHG emissions projections help us measure progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.

Each includes a file named readme_lisezmoi.txt, which provides additional details about the data included in each sub-folder.\r\n\r\n• The sub-folder named \"GHG - GES\" includes tables presenting GHG emissions data.\r\n\r\n• The sub-folder named \"Energy - Énergie\" includes tables presenting energy and macroeconomic data for each sector included in the \"GHG - GES\"
