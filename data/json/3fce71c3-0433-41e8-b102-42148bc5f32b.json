{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Les auteurs de menace ont de plus en plus recours aux rançongiciels et personne n’en est à l’abri. En effet, des citoyens, de petites entreprises, de grandes entreprises privées et des organismes gouvernementaux peuvent en être victimes. Il est donc important de mettre en place un plan stratégique pour prévenir ce type d’attaque, de se préparer au pire scénario et de penser à l’approche à adopter pour se remettre d’une éventuelle infection par rançongiciel. Le présent document décrit le fonctionnement d’un rançongiciel et les étapes que l’on peut prendre pour les prévenir, aborde la décision de payer ou non les auteurs de menace, et suggère des mesures à prendre pour se remettre d’une attaque.","en":"Ransomware is becoming an increasingly common threat, targeting everyone from individuals and small businesses to large private enterprises and government organizations.
