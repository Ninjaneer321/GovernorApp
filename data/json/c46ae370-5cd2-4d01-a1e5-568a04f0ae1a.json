{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Ce document présente les avantages et les risques liés à l’utilisation de services fondés sur l’infonuagique qui fournissent des capacités de traitement informatique en tant que service plutôt que produit. Les fournisseurs de services infonuagiques (FSI) proposent des environnements informatiques évolutifs sur demande. Dans l’ensemble, les services fondés sur l’infonuagique offrent une plus grande souplesse que les solutions de TI locales, de même qu’un ensemble de capacités qui permettront de libérer les ressources de votre organisation. Par contre, de tels services ne protègent pas nécessairement les actifs qui sont stockés par leur intermédiaire. Il incombe toujours aux hauts responsables de protéger la confidentialité, l’intégrité et la disponibilité de l’information et des services de TI. Votre organisation sera appelée à établir toutes les exigences opérationnelles et de sécurité, et à gérer tous les risques connexes.\r\n","en":"This document introduces the benefits and the risks of using cloud-based services, which deliver computer processing capabilities as a service rather than as a product.
