Est-ce là qu’on effectue la mise en œuvre de l’infonuagique? Comment puis-je m’y prendre pour en tirer avantage? Il y a plus de 20 ans, on utilisait l’image d’un nuage pour représenter Internet. C’est ce à quoi vous faites référence? Le nuage n’est en fait qu’Internet? Eh bien... en quelque sorte... peut-être.\r\n\r\nImaginez que l’infonuagique est un ensemble d’entreprises qui vendent une puissance informatique. Leurs clients accèdent à cette puissance informatique au moyen d’Internet. C’est tout. Il n’y a rien de magique.\r\n\r\nOn entend, par infonuagique, l’utilisation des ordinateurs d’un fournisseur de services d’infonuagique (FSI) dans le but de stocker des données et des programmes sur Internet, d’y accéder et de les manipuler. Les FSI investissent massivement dans l’achat d’équipement, de logiciels et d’applications, puis vendent l’utilisation de cet équipement, de ces services et de ces applications.\"\r\n","en":"\"Lately, everyone is talking about The Cloud.
