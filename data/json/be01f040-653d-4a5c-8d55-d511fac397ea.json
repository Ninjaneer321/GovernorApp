{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Le 30 octobre 2003, le Programme de contributions CASSIOPE a été autorisé pour une période de cinq ans. Le projet a été prolongé, car le lancement du satellite a été reporté plusieurs fois. Le lancement a finalement eu lieu en septembre 2013. La mission CASSIOPE combine trois éléments de programme : elle prévoit l'intégration de deux charges utiles, à savoir la charge utile Cascade de démonstration en télécommunications et la sonde de mesure de l'écoulement du plasma dans le vent polaire (ePOP), sur une seule petite plateforme satellitaire (SmallSAT) générique de conception canadienne.\r\n\r\nL'Agence spatiale canadienne (ASC) a conclu deux accords de contribution. L'un avec MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) et sa filiale, Cascade Data Services Inc., en vue de la phase de démonstration générale de la technologie de la mission CASSIOPE, comprenant la charge utile Cascade, l'intégration de la charge utile ePOP et les phases C et D (développement et fabrication) de la plateforme SmallSAT. L'autre a été conclu avec l'Université de Calgary concernant la charge utile ePOP.\r\n\r\nLe financement total du projet CASSIOPE était de 75 millions de dollars (plus 6 millions de dollars pour les coûts internes de l'ASC). De plus, le Programme de partenariat technologique d'Industrie Canada a fourni 48,6 millions de dollars supplémentaires en financement à MDA au moyen d'un accord de contribution séparé.\r\n\r\nL'évaluation du Programme de contributions CASSIOPE, pour le compte de la Direction de la vérification et de l'évaluation de l'ASC a été réalisée par Kelly Sears Consulting Group, en partenariat avec Beechwood Consulting and Research Inc., BBMD Consulting Inc. et Hickling Arthurs Low Corp.","en":"The CASSIOPE Contribution Program was authorized for a five-year period on October 30, 2003.
