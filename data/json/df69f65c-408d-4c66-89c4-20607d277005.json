{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Ce jeu de données porte sur le suivi de la phénologie des plantes. Il s’agit d’une mesure qui permet de vérifier la variation dans le temps des dates de floraison et de feuillaison de différentes espèces ainsi que de mesurer l’impact des changements climatiques sur l’écosystème forestier du parc. Les niveaux d’avancement des critères de floraison sont établis au printemps, en moyenne deux fois par semaine, à partir d’observations terrain sur différents sites. \r\nLe choix des espèces pour le suivi de la floraison au parc national de Forillon a été fait en fonction des plantes recommandées sur le site d’Opération Floraison, de leur facilité d’observation (proximité du centre opérationnel) et en évitant les sites aux conditions d'ensoleillement ou de température inhabituelles (proximité de route pavée, fondation de béton, etc.). Ce sont donc les espèces suivantes qui ont été retenues : érable rouge (Acer rubrum), peuplier faux-tremble (Populus tremuloides), fraisier sauvage (Fragaria virginiana/vesca), quatre-temps (Cornus canadensis) et clintonie boréale (Clintonia borealis).","en":"This dataset focuses on monitoring plant phenology.
