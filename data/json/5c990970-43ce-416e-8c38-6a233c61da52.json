Lorsqu’ils travaillent à distance, vos employés doivent avoir accès aux services, aux applications et aux informations internes dont ils se serviraient normalement s’ils travaillaient depuis le bureau. Cependant, votre organisation doit également protéger ses systèmes et ses informations, et le travail à distance comporte sa part de risques. Vous devez donc mettre en place des mesures de sécurité additionnelles visant à empêcher les auteurs malveillants d’exploiter d’éventuelles vulnérabilités de vos systèmes.\r\n","en":"Remote work introduces some challenges when trying to balance functionality with security.
