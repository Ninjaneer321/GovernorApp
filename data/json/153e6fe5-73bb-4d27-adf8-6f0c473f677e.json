{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC) instaure actuellement une gestion du risque et souhaite que ce processus devienne un élément propre à la culture ministérielle. Veiller à tirer parti des expériences en examinant régulièrement le processus de gestion du risque est important pour assurer l’avancement de ce processus à ACC. C’est la raison qui explique le présent examen du caractère adéquat de la gestion des risques ministériels à ACC. \r\n\r\nLes résultats de l’examen ont été obtenus un an après l’élaboration d’un Cadre de gestion du risque à ACC. La pleine application et le fonctionnement des politiques et des pratiques de gestion du risque d’ACC ne sont pas encore choses acquises. Le Ministère doit planifier à long terme et reconnaître que la mise en œuvre efficace de la gestion du risque est un processus de longue haleine. Pour assurer une mise en œuvre complète et efficace, il est essentiel de cerner les lacunes quant à la capacité de gestion les risques, d’assurer une bonne communication, d’offrir une formation, d’assurer le perfectionnement de l’expertise à l’interne, de déterminer, définir et clarifier les rôles. ","en":"Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) is in the process of implementing risk management with the goal of it becoming a natural part of Departmental culture.  Ensuring effective learning from experience by undertaking regular reviews of the risk management process is significant to the advancement of the maturity of this process at VAC.  Thus, this review of the adequacy of corporate risk management at VAC has been undertaken.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the review are one year after the development of a Risk Management Framework within VAC.  The maturity of the implementation and functioning of VAC’s risk management policies and practices remains a work-in-progress.  The Department must plan for the long-term; recognizing that effective implementation of risk management will take time.  Critical to the success of full implementation is development of risk management capacity gaps, effective communication, training and development of internal expertise, identification, definition and clarity of roles.
