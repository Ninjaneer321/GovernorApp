Le plan a été élaboré pour répondre aux engagements de l'ASPC en vertu de la Politique sur les résultats (2016), qui exige que chaque ministère prépare un plan quinquennal, mis à jour annuellement. Les projets inclus dans ce plan d'évaluation ont été sélectionnés pour assurer une couverture complète de toutes les dépenses en subventions et contributions supérieures à 5 millions de dollars par an sur une période de cinq ans, des engagements antérieurs dans les présentations au Conseil du Trésor, des besoins en matière d'information de la gestion de programme, des risques du programme et de l'utilisation optimale des ressources. Ce plan se fonde sur le Cadre ministériel des résultats (CMR), le répertoire des programmes et les profils d'information sur le rendement qui ont été élaborés par l'ASPC.","en":"The Office of Audit and Evaluation (OAE) Departmental Evaluation Plan for PHAC describes the Program Evaluation Division's scheduled work for the five-year period from 2021-22 to 2025-26.
