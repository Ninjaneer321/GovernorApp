La Directive s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’examen, par la ministre de la Justice et procureur général du Canada, de la stratégie du gouvernement du Canada en matière de litiges. Ceci vise à veiller à ce que les prises de position juridiques du gouvernement cadrent avec ses engagements, envers la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés et les valeurs canadiennes. Conformément aux Principes régissant la relation du gouvernement du Canada avec les peuples autochtones, la Directive met l’accent sur l’importance de régler les conflits rapidement et de manière collaborative, et ainsi de limiter le recours aux litiges et aux tribunaux. ","en":"The Directive on Civil Litigation Involving Indigenous Peoples will guide the Government of Canada’s legal approaches, positions and decisions taken in civil litigation involving Aboriginal and treaty rights, and the Crown’s obligation towards Indigenous peoples. The Directive is part of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada’s work to review the Government of Canada’s litigation strategy. This is to ensure the Government’s legal positions are consistent with its commitments, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Canadian values. Consistent with the Principles Respecting the Government of Canada’s Relationship with Indigenous Peoples, the Directive emphasizes the importance of resolving conflicts expeditiously and collaboratively, reducing the use of litigation and the courts.
