{"notes_translated":{"fr":"La première édition de l'Atlas du Canada (1906) comprend une carte qui représente les limites septentrionales d'approximativement 40 essences forestières au Canada. Cette carte couvre également la partie nord des États-Unis. À l'aide de lignes vertes, la carte démontre les limites septentrionales des essences principales de la forêt méridionale. Les lignes rouges indiquent les limites des essences de la forêt de la Cordillère. Pour cette carte et la carte des forêts de l'Atlas du Canada, la ligne de division entre les forêts méridionales et septentrionales est considérée comme la limite septentrionale des pins rouges et blancs. Ces essences sont associées à la forêt septentrionale, incluant celles dont les limites sont au sud des limites des pins de la forêt méridionale. La carte inclut également des rivières, les plans d'eau principaux et quelques essences identifiées à des endroits précis.","en":"Contained within the 1st Edition (1906) of the Atlas of Canada is a map that shows the northern limits of approximately 40 different tree species in Canada, including an extension into the Northern U.S. Using green lines the map displays the northern limits of the principal trees found within the Southern Forest. Blue lines indicate the northern, and in a few incidences the southern, limits of the principal trees found within the Northern Forest. Red lines show the limits of the trees within the Cordilleran Forest. For this map, and the Atlas of Canada Forests map, the line of division between the Northern and Southern Forests has been taken as the northern limit of red and white pine. These trees are assigned to the Northern Forest, including those whose limit is south of the pine tree limits within the Southern Forest. The map also includes, rivers, major bodies of water, and a few tree types labeled in specific locations."},"imso_approval":"true","maintainer":null,"association_type":[],"org_section":{},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"NRCan.geogratis-geogratis.RNCan@canada.ca","num_tags":0,"contributor":{},"frequency":"as_needed","keywords":{"fr":["arbre","bois","foresterie","forêt","industrie forestière","produit forestier"],"en":["forestry","forestry industry","forestry products","forests","trees","wood"]},"data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"No. 9","en":"No. 9"},"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"e06619ed-283d-55b8-9aa9-ffdcc448598c","metadata_created":"2016-09-26T14:31:43.930912","subject":["nature_and_environment","science_and_technology"],"spatial_representation_type":[],"metadata_modified":"2017-01-26T21:46:58.128618","author":null,"author_email":"NRCan.geogratis-geogratis.RNCan@canada.ca","geographic_region":[],"position_name":{},"portal_release_date":"2017-01-18","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"presentation_form":"map_hardcopy","relationships_as_object":[],"creator_user_id":"aa584ab4-544c-4c5c-81da-d1cff9bd96fa","title_translated":{"fr":"Limites des essences forestières","en":"Limits of Forest Trees"},"type":"dataset","resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"e06619ed-283d-55b8-9aa9-ffdcc448598c","datastore_active":false,"id":"7e22484a-73f3-4689-a8b7-ea55832e100e","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Télécharger le fichier en format JPG via HTTP","en":"Download JPG through HTTP"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"JPG","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Download JPG through HTTP","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2017-01-26T16:46:58.752080","url":"http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_1_ed/eng/environment/ecology/page9.jpg","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":0,"revision_id":"2735ef2e-a829-4acd-b187-dd1f166b2dd6","resource_type":"dataset"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"package_id":"e06619ed-283d-55b8-9aa9-ffdcc448598c","datastore_active":false,"id":"87c5bcb9-6722-4122-97ae-411cf524484b","state":"active","name_translated":{"fr":"Télécharger le fichier en format PDF via HTTP","en":"Download PDF through HTTP"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"PDF","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"Download PDF through HTTP","language":["en","fr"],"created":"2017-01-26T16:46:58.752130","url":"http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_1_ed/eng/environment/ecology/page9.pdf","last_modified":null,"data_quality":[],"position":1,"revision_id":"2735ef2e-a829-4acd-b187-dd1f166b2dd6","resource_type":"dataset"}],"place_of_publication":[],"metadata_contact":{},"num_resources":2,"topic_category":["biota","environment","inland_waters"],"tags":[],"spatial":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-150.0, 70.0], [-150.0, 36.0], [-52.0, 36.0], [-52.0, 70.0], [-150.0, 70.0]]]}","collection":"geogratis","org_title_at_publication":{"fr":"Ressources naturelles Canada","en":"Natural Resources Canada"},"date_published":"1906-06-30 00:00:00","display_flags":[],"groups":[],"license_id":"ca-ogl-lgo","data_series_name":{"fr":"Atlas du Canada, 1e édition","en":"Atlas of Canada, 1st Edition"},"relationships_as_subject":[],"license_title":"Open Government Licence - Canada","restrictions":"unrestricted","organization":{"description":"","created":"2016-09-23T17:25:46.737130","title":"Natural Resources Canada | Ressources naturelles Canada","name":"nrcan-rncan","is_organization":true,"state":"active","image_url":"","revision_id":"a0c5bf0d-8541-443d-a8bf-b04a249733f4","type":"organization","id":"9391E0A2-9717-4755-B548-4499C21F917B","approval_status":"approved"},"name":"e06619ed-283d-55b8-9aa9-ffdcc448598c","isopen":false,"url":"{u'fr': u'http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/fr/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/e06619ed-283d-55b8-9aa9-ffdcc448598c', u'en': u'http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/e06619ed-283d-55b8-9aa9-ffdcc448598c'}","notes":"Contained within the 1st Edition (1906) of the Atlas of Canada is a map that shows the northern limits of approximately 40 different tree species in Canada, including an extension into the Northern U.S. Using green lines the map displays the northern limits of the principal trees found within the Southern Forest.
