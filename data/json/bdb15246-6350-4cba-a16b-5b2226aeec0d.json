{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Le 23 mars 2004, le gouvernement a annoncé une nouvelle politique concernant la publication obligatoire des marchés de plus de 10 000 $. À l'époque, certains types de marchés étaient exclus des exigences en matière de divulgation proactive, principalement les marchés de services juridiques. Le SCT a révisé les Lignes directrices sur la divulgation proactive des marchés du Conseil du Trésor afin de supprimer l'exception relative aux marchés de services juridiques. Selon les lignes directrices actuelles, les seuls marchés exemptés des obligations de divulgation proactive sont ceux où la divulgation de renseignements nuirait à des enquêtes criminelles, à la sécurité nationale ou à la sécurité publique.\r\n\r\nCe site Web fournit de l'information concernant les mandataires nommés par le ministre de la Justice et les marchés de services juridiques connexes attribués par le ministère de la Justice. Le Ministère a pour politique générale de confier à ses juristes les services juridiques relevant du mandat qui lui est conféré par la loi. Cependant, le Ministère reconnaît que dans certains cas, ces services peuvent ou doivent être impartis à des mandataires. La Politique sur les marchés de services juridiques et la nomination des mandataires du ministère de la Justice énonce les principes qui guident la nomination des mandataires.\r\n\r\nTous les trois mois, nous présenterons un rapport sur les nouvelles nominations de mandataires effectuées par le ministre de la Justice pour le trimestre visé par le rapport. Au plus tard le 30 juin suivant le dernier rapport trimestriel de chaque exercice financier, un rapport comprendra les dépenses annuelles totales, par cabinet, à partir des montants vérifiés par le Ministère, lorsque la valeur totale des montants vérifiés est supérieure à 10 000 $ au cours de l'exercice financier visé par le rapport. Cette approche établit un équilibre entre le besoin de transparence et la divulgation de renseignements relatifs aux marchés, tout en prenant en considération que des aspects des marchés de services juridiques sont protégés par le privilège du secret professionnel de l'avocat et le privilège relatif au litige. La divulgation dans son ensemble donne, à tous les égards importants, une image fidèle de la situation, conformément aux Lignes directrices sur la divulgation proactive des marchés du SCT.","en":"On March 23, 2004, the Government announced a new policy on the mandatory publication of contracts over $10,000. At the time, certain types of contracts were excluded from the proactive disclosure requirements, chief among these being contracts for legal services. TBS has revised the Treasury Board Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts to remove the exemption for contracts for legal services. Under the current guidelines, the only contracts exempted from proactive disclosure obligations are those where disclosure of information would compromise criminal investigations, national security, negotiations or public safety.\r\n\r\nThis Website provides information on legal agents appointed by the Minister of Justice and the related contracts for legal services issued by the Department of Justice. The general policy of the Department is that legal services within the department's statutory mandate should be handled by departmental counsel. The Department recognizes, however, that there are instances when such services may or should be outsourced to legal agents. The Department of Justice's Policy on Contracting for Legal Services and Legal Agent Appointments sets out the principles which guide the appointment of legal agents.\r\n\r\nEvery three months we will be reporting new legal agent appointments made by the Minister of Justice in the quarter being reported. By June 30th, following the last quarterly report for each fiscal year, a report will include the total annual expenditures by firm, based on amounts taxed by the Department, where the aggregate value of amounts taxed exceeds $10,000.00 in the fiscal year being reported. This approach balances the need for transparency and disclosure of contract information with the recognition that aspects of contracts for legal services are protected by solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege.
