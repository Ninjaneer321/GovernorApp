{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Depuis 1980, on prélève des échantillons de neige pendant les phases d'accumulation et d'ablation à 13 sites au plus dans le bassin des lacs Turkey, situé dans la région d'Algoma, dans le centre de l'Ontario, au Canada, mais c'est surtout à partir de 1989 qu'un plus grand nombre d'études quantitatives ont été entreprises. On fournit des mesures de l'épaisseur de la neige et une description physique de l'accumulation de neige à chacune des stations. On détermine également la densité de la neige, l'équivalent en eau et la chimie (pH, ions majeurs et éléments nutritifs). Depuis 2012, les analyses chimiques n'ont été effectuées que sur trois sites de neige, bien que la densité et l'équivalent en eau aient été mesurés pour les autres stations.\r\n\r\nRenseignements supplémentaires\r\n\r\nLe programme Changements climatiques et pollution de l'air (CCPA) a été établi en 2016 pour déterminer la gravité et l'étendue des effets néfastes des émissions atmosphériques actuelles et futures sur les écosystèmes aquatiques afin d'appuyer les mesures réglementaires et l'élaboration de politiques. Le programme comprend un certain nombre d'éléments, notamment l'identification, la surveillance et la définition des préoccupations relatives à la qualité de l'air et aux gaz à effet de serre (GES) ; améliorer notre compréhension des effets à court et à long terme des polluants atmosphériques sur l'environnement; élaborer un plan de lutte contre le changement climatique; et surveiller et réduire les émissions nationales et transfrontières de GES. Le programme est également chargé d'identifier et d'étudier les problèmes émergents, y compris les impacts multi-pollutants, les principales sources urbaines et les effets de l'augmentation de la chaleur sur la formation des polluants atmosphériques, entre autres.\r\n\r\nSoutien continu et coopération des provinces et des territoires, des gouvernements internationaux et des organisations, et du milieu universitaire sont essentiels pour offrir ces priorités aux Canadiens. ","en":"The snowpack has been sampled during both the accumulation and ablation stages at as many as 13 sites within the Turkey Lakes Watershed, Algoma, central Ontario, Canada since 1980, although more quantitative surveys began in 1989. Snow depth and a physical description of snowpack have been recorded at each station. Snow density, water equivalent and chemistry (major ions, pH and nutrients) have been determined. Since 2012, chemistry has only been completed on up to three sites although snow density and water equivalent have been measured at the others.\r\n\r\nSupplemental Information\r\n\r\nThe Climate Change and Air Pollution (CCAP) program was established in 2016 to identify the severity and extent of adverse impacts of current and future air emissions on aquatic ecosystems to support regulatory actions and policy development. The program includes a number of components, including identifying, monitoring and defining air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) concerns; improving our understanding of the short- and long-term effects of atmospheric pollutants on the environment; developing a plan to combat climate change; and monitoring and reducing both domestic and transboundary emissions of GHGs. The program is also responsible for identifying and studying emerging issues including multipollutant impacts, major urban sources, and effects of increasing heat on air pollutant formation, among others.\r\n\r\nOn-going cooperation and support with the Provinces and Territories, international governments and organizations and academia are vital to deliver these priorities to Canadians.

snowpack has been sampled during both the accumulation and ablation stages at as many as 13 sites within the Turkey Lakes Watershed, Algoma, central Ontario, Canada since 1980, although more quantitative surveys began in 1989. Snow depth and a physical description of snowpack have been recorded at each station. Snow density, water equivalent and chemistry (major ions, pH and nutrients) have been determined. Since 2012, chemistry has only been completed on up to three sites although snow density and water equivalent have been measured at the others.\r\n\r\nSupplemental Information\r\n\r\nThe Climate Change and Air Pollution (CCAP) program was established in 2016 to identify the severity and extent of adverse impacts of current and future air emissions on aquatic ecosystems to support regulatory actions and policy development. The program includes a number of components, including identifying, monitoring and defining air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) concerns; improving our understanding of the short- and long-term effects of atmospheric pollutants on the environment; developing a plan to combat climate change; and monitoring and reducing both domestic and transboundary emissions of GHGs. The program is also responsible for identifying and studying emerging issues including multipollutant impacts, major urban sources, and effects of increasing heat on air pollutant formation, among others.\r\n\r\nOn-going cooperation and support with the Provinces and Territories, international governments and organizations and academia are vital to deliver these priorities to Canadians.
