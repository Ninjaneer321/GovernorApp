{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Les opinions exprimées dans le présent rapport sont\r\ncelles de l’auteur et ne représentent pas nécessairement\r\n les opinions du ministère de la Justice du Canada. \r\n\r\nLe présent document porte sur trois questions : nous\r\nexaminerons d’abord ce qu’est un « crime d’honneur » afin d’établir la définition que nous utiliserons ici; nous verrons ensuite où les crimes d’honneur se produisent en nous penchant sur des incidents signalés au Canada; puis, nous nous demanderons pourquoi\r\ndes crimes d’honneur sont commis en étudiant la psychopathologie qui intervient lorsque de tels actes criminels. \r\n\r\nDe nombreuses études ont documenté la perception, chez certaines familles habitant dans des collectivités situées hors du Canada, selon laquelle, pour rétablir l’honneur de la famille, un membre de celle-ci doit tuer la personne qui a supposément déshonoré la famille aux yeux de la collectivité. Si le terme « crime d’honneur » est très répandu, il importe de souligner d’entrée de jeu qu’il est également controversé. \r\n\r\nD’un autre côté, les meurtres commis au nom de l’honneur comportent des aspects uniques qu’il convient de souligner dans le cadre d’un exercice de description et d’analyse et qui ont des conséquences pratiques sur la protection des victimes, en plus de comporter des éléments de psychopathologie, notamment la préméditation et la complicité. \r\n\r\nLes notions intimement liées d’« honneur » et de « honte » et leur utilisation pour justifier les actes de violence et les homicides se retrouvent dans bon nombre de cultures. Le phénomène des crimes d’honneur tire ses origines de nombreuses régions du monde : l’Amérique latine, l’Europe, le Moyen-Orient et l’Asie du Sud, notamment.\r\n\r\nSi le fait d’utiliser l’honneur comme un motif culturel pour justifier le meurtre est ancré dans la mentalité de certains groupes, il ne peut être attribué à des populations entières, puisque bon nombre de personnes d’un même pays ne partagent pas ce système de\r\ncroyances. L’existence de normes et de pratiques culturelles ne diminue pas la responsabilité individuelle, sauf en de rares occasions, lorsqu’une personne présente une psychopathologie assez importante.

Honour killings are not associated with particular religions or religious practice: they have been recorded across Christian, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu and Muslim communities. Often, honour killings are not a religiously motivated crime, but are based on personal agendas, personal ego and personal mindset.

From the literature review and media reports, it is evident that honour killings do occasionally occur in Canada. So far, over the past decade in Canada there have been at least a dozen reported homicides which appear\r\nto have been honour killings.
