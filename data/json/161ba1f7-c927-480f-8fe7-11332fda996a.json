{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Une Vision commune pour favoriser l’activité physique et réduire la sédentarité au Canada : Soyons actifs est le premier appel à l’action de ce genre jamais lancé au Canada. Le Canada n’a encore jamais accordé une attention stratégique particulière à l’activité physique et à sa relation avec le sport, le loisir, la santé et d’autres domaines d’intérêt public. Qui plus est, le présent document aborde la question cruciale de la sédentarité. La Vision commune représente une nouvelle voie collective qui guidera notre pays vers des stratégies permettant d’accroître l’activité physique et de réduire la sédentarité au Canada. Il s’agit d’un document de politique nationale qui vise à faire bouger le pays.","en":"A Common Vision for Increasing Physical Activity and Reducing Sedentary Living in Canada: Let’s Get Moving is the first-ever call to action of its kind in Canada. Never before has Canada had a singular policy focus on physical activity and its relationship to sport, recreation, health, as well as other relevant policy areas.  What’s more, this document also addresses the critical issue of sedentary living. It is a new, collective way forward that will guide the country towards ways of increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary living in Canada.
