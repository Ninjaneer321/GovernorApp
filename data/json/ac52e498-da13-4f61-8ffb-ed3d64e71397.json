{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels (LPRP) (Lois révisées du Canada (1985), chapitre P-21) a été promulguée le\r\n1 juillet 1983. La LPRP confère aux Canadiens et aux résidents permanents un droit d'accès aux renseignements que détient le gouvernement à leur sujet, sous réserve de certaines conditions précises et limitées. Elle protège également la vie privée des particuliers en empêchant les tiers d'avoir accès à des renseignements personnels, et elle leur permet d'exercer un contrôle important sur la collecte et l'utilisation de ces renseignements.\r\n\r\nEn vertu de l'article 72 de la LPRP, le responsable de toute institution fédérale doit, à chaque exercice, préparer un rapport sur l'application de cette loi au sein de son organisation et le soumettre au Parlement.\r\n\r\nCe rapport est donc présenté par le Commissariat au lobbying (CAL) en vertu de la LPRP. Il décrit comment le CAL s'est acquitté de ses responsabilités en vertu de la LPRP durant l'année financière 2019-2020.","en":"he Privacy Act (Revised Statute of Canada 1985, Chapter P-21) was proclaimed on July 1, 1983.
