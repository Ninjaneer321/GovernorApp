{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La ministre de la Justice prépare un « Énoncé concernant la Charte » afin d'éclairer le débat public et parlementaire au sujet d'un projet de loi du gouvernement. L'une des plus importantes responsabilités de la ministre de la Justice est d'examiner le projet de loi afin d'évaluer la conformité avec la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés (« la Charte »). Par le dépôt d'un Énoncé concernant la Charte, la ministre partage plusieurs des considérations principales ayant informé l'examen de la conformité d'un projet de loi avec la Charte. L'Énoncé recense les droits et libertés garantis par la Charte susceptibles d'être touchés par un projet de loi et il explique brièvement la nature de ces répercussions, eu égard aux mesures proposées.\r\n\r\nUn Énoncé concernant la Charte présente également les raisons pouvant justifier les restrictions qu'un projet de loi pourrait imposer aux droits et libertés garantis par la Charte.\r\n\r\nUn Énoncé concernant la Charte vise à fournir des informations juridiques au public et au Parlement. Il ne s'agit PAS d'un exposé détaillé de toutes les considérations liées à la Charte envisageables. Un Énoncé ne constitue PAS un avis juridique sur la constitutionnalité d'un projet de loi.\r\n","en":"The Minister of Justice prepares a \"Charter Statement\" to help inform the public and Parliamentary debate on a government bill.
