{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La pandémie de COVID-19 est un événement extrêmement perturbateur qui touche toutes les composantes de la société. Et le monde des TI n’est pas immunisé. La pandémie a contraint les secteurs public et privé à repenser comment, quand, et où le travail est effectué. Les modèles traditionnels des environnements de travail au bureau et à domicile ont été complètement inversés; dans de nombreux cas, une majorité d’employés font du télétravail. Cette inversion force les membres de la direction, les responsables de la mise en œuvre et les clients des TI à s’adapter à une nouvelle façon de travailler. Malheureusement, cette transformation rapide présente de nouvelles possibilités pour les auteurs de cybermenaces qui tentent par tous les moyens d’en profiter. Il est impératif que l’ensemble de la chaîne hiérarchique des TI, de la direction aux clients, soit sensibilisée à ce sujet et que l’on prenne toutes les précautions possibles.\r\n","en":"The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be an extremely disruptive event, affecting all components of society.
