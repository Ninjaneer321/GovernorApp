Il remplacera alors les anciennes dispositions du Code criminel relatives à la légitime défense et à la défense des biens par de nouveaux moyens de défense améliorés.\r\n\r\ntransition. Le présent guide vise avant tout à favoriser l’émergence, au sein de la communauté juridique, d’une compréhension commune de l’objet et de l’effet des mesures de réforme ainsi que d’un ensemble commun d’arguments quant à leur application et à leur interprétation, et ce, de manière à ce qu’une jurisprudence utile et cohérente puisse se dégager le plus rapidement possible en évitant toute possibilité de confusion et d’incertitude.\r\n\r\nEn adoptant le projet de loi C-26, le législateur voulait avant tout simplifier le texte législatif qui prévoit les moyens de défense. Actuellement, la légitime défense et la défense des biens occupent neuf articles dans le Code criminel (art. 34 à 42). On trouve plusieurs versions distinctes de chaque moyen défense, chacune visant apparemment des circonstances légèrement différentes pour son application.\r\n\r\nLe public n’était pas servi par un texte législatif que même les juges avaient de la difficulté à comprendre et à expliquer.\r\n\r\nLes nouvelles dispositions législatives sur la légitime défense renferment une liste non exhaustive de facteurs applicables à l’évaluation du caractère raisonnable des actes de l’accusé dans les circonstances.","en":"Bill C-26 the Citizens Arrest and Self-defence Act, S.C. 2012 c.9, came into force on march 11, 2013.
