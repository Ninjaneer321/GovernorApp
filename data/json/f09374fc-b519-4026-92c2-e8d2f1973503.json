{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"À l’instar d’autres organismes, le gouvernement du Canada (GC) se tourne vers les services infonuagiques (ou d’informatique en nuage) pour améliorer la prestation de ses services et la gestion de son information. Les services infonuagiques permettent d’accéder sur demande aux applications et aux services depuis des centres de données commerciaux plutôt que les systèmes d’information internes du GC. Ils aideront le GC à offrir des services en ligne aux Canadiens et à leur garantir un accès rapide à l’information. En revanche, ce qui rend les services infonuagiques si intéressants fait également d’eux une cible attrayante pour les auteurs de cybermenaces.\r\n","en":"The Government of Canada (GC), as well as other organizations, are turning to cloud services to improve service delivery and information management.
