{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"L’allocation pour perte de revenus figure parmi les mesures de soutien offertes dans le cadre du Programme d’avantages financiers d’Anciens Combattants Canada. Cette allocation sert à compenser l’impact financier d’une invalidité liée au service militaire ou d’une invalidité mettant fin à la carrière sur la capacité du vétéran de jouir d’un revenu après sa libération des Forces armées canadiennes. Ce substitut de revenu permet d’éviter que le revenu du vétéran admissible ne tombe en deçà de 75 % de la solde brute qu’il gagnait avant sa libération. Le revenu minimal garanti pour l’exercice 2012-2013 était de 41 598 $. Le revenu minimal garanti est rajusté en fonction des augmentations à la solde de base d’un caporal.\r\n\r\nLes vérificateurs avaient pour mission de s’assurer que le programme et les mécanismes de contrôle financier fonctionnent comme prévu et qu’ils produisent des résultats conformes aux pouvoirs correspondants. L’allocation pour perte de revenus n’avait pas été soumise à une vérification depuis l’adoption de la Loi sur les mesures de réinsertion et d’indemnisation des militaires et vétérans des Forces canadiennes en 2005. ","en":"The Earnings Loss benefit is one of the supports available through Veterans Affairs Canada’s Financial Benefits Program. Earnings Loss is payable in recognition of the economic impact a military career-ending or service-related disability may have on the Veteran’s ability to earn income following release from the Canadian Armed Forces. This income replacement ensures that the eligible Veteran's income does not fall below 75% of their gross pre-release military salary. The guaranteed minimum rate for fiscal year 2012-2013 was $41,598. This guaranteed minimum rate is adjusted based on increases to the basic corporal’s salary.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the audit was to provide assurance that the program and financial controls were working as intended to deliver results in accordance with related authorities. In addition, the Earnings Loss benefit has not been subject to an audit since the inception of the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re-establishment and Compensation Act in 2005.
