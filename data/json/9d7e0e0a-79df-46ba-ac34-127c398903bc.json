{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"L’évaluation du programme de prestations d’invalidité a été effectuée conformément au Plan d’évaluation pluriannuel axé sur les risques de 2014-2019 d’Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC). \r\n\r\nL’objectif du programme de prestations d’invalidité est d’indemniser les vétérans, les militaires et d’autres personnes en reconnaissance des effets des invalidités ou du décès attribuables au service, à une incarcération ou à une évasion.\r\n\r\nLe programme de prestations d’invalidité inclut les pensions d’invalidité et les indemnités d’invalidité. La Loi sur les pensions de 1919 fournit le cadre pour la pension d’invalidité, qui est un paiement mensuel non imposable dont le montant est calculé en fonction de la mesure dans laquelle l’invalidité diagnostiquée est liée aux états de service. L’indemnité d’invalidité, qui a été établie en 2006 en vertu de la Nouvelle Charte des anciens combattants (la Nouvelle Charte), permet d’offrir aux militaires et vétérans blessés un paiement forfaitaire non imposable pour une blessure ou une maladie découlant du service militaire, dont le montant dépend de la gravité de l’invalidité. Le programme de prestations d’invalidité donne accès à d’autres programmes, services et avantages d’ACC.\r\n","en":"The evaluation of the Disability Benefits program was conducted in accordance with the Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) Multi-Year Risk-Based Evaluation Plan 2014–19. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the Disability Benefits program is to compensate Veterans/members and other individuals in recognition of the effects of service-related disabilities, death or incarceration/evasion/escape. \r\n\r\nThe Disability Benefits program consists of both the Disability Pension and the Disability Award.
