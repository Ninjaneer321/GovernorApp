{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Le Cabinet du juge-avocat général supervise l'administration de la justice militaire. Ils offrent des conseils juridiques au gouverneur général et au ministre, ainsi que dans les bases et les escadres, et dans l'ensemble de la Défense nationale. Ils fournissent des avocats pour défendre les accusés devant les cours martiales, donnent des cours aux militaires et conseillent les commandants sur les principes éthiques et juridiques établis par les Forces armées canadiennes (FAC) et le gouvernement du Canada. \r\n\r\nCet ensemble de données comprend le résumé des résultats des dossiers complets. Un dossier est ouvert pour chaque accusé qui demande les services d'un avocat de la défense et est considéré comme le dossier officiel du directeur des services d'avocat de la défense. Une affaire terminée est une affaire qui a été retirée, non privilégiée ou qui est allée en cour martiale et la cour martiale est terminée. Les résultats de ces dossiers complets comprennent les conclusions de la cour martiale, la suspension des accusations, le retrait des accusations ou le non-lieu, ce qui mettra fin au dossier. \r\n\r\nLa cour martiale – un tribunal militaire formel présidé par un juge militaire – est conçue pour traiter des infractions plus graves. Les cours martiales sont conduites conformément à des règles et procédures similaires à celles des cours pénales civiles et ont les mêmes droits, pouvoirs et privilèges qu'une cour supérieure de juridiction pénale en ce qui concerne toutes les « questions nécessaires ou appropriées pour le bon exercice de [leur] juridiction.","en":"The Office of the Judge Advocate General oversees the administration of military justice. They offer legal advice to the Governor General and the Minister, as well as at bases and wings, and all across National Defence.

A case file is opened for every accused that requests Defence Cousel services and is considered the official record for the Director of Defence Counsel Services.  A completed case is a case that has either been withdrawn, non-preferred or went to Court Martial and the Court Martial is over.  The results of these completed case files include findings at court martial, stay of charges, withdrawal of charges or non preferral of charges which will bring the file to a close.  \r\n\r\nThe court martial – a formal military court presided over by a military judge – is designed to deal with more serious offences.
