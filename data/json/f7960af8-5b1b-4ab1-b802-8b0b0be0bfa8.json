{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La COVID-19 cause une infection de type respiratoire qui est bénigne pour la majorité de la population, mais elle peut être plus grave chez les adultes plus âgés ou les personnes qui ont un problème de santé chronique sous-jacent. Le fait d’avoir un handicap ne représente pas nécessairement un risque plus élevé de contracter la COVID-19 ou de devenir gravement malade si vous la contractez. Cependant, certaines personnes handicapées pourraient présenter un risque accru d’infection ou de maladie grave en raison de leur âge, d’un problème de santé sous-jacent ou de leur handicap. Ainsi, elles pourraient être plus susceptibles d’être exposées au virus et de le contracter.","en":"COVID-19 causes a respiratory type infection that is mild in most of the population but can be more severe in those who are older adults or those with chronic underlying conditions. Having a disability alone may not put you at higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness if you do get COVID-19. However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their age, underlying medical conditions or their disability which could put them at greater risk of being exposed and acquiring the infection."},"issn":"","imso_approval":"true","isbn":"","creator":"","org_section":{"fr":"","en":""},"jurisdiction":"federal","private":false,"maintainer_email":"open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca","num_tags":0,"edition":"","frequency":"as_needed","data_series_issue_identification":{"fr":"","en":""},"contributor":{"fr":"","en":""},"maintainer":null,"ready_to_publish":"true","id":"f7960af8-5b1b-4ab1-b802-8b0b0be0bfa8","metadata_created":"2020-05-13T15:31:14.920808","subject":["health_and_safety"],"pspc_identification_number":"","metadata_modified":"2020-05-13T15:31:14.920836","author":null,"author_email":null,"geographic_region":[],"portal_release_date":"2020-05-13","digital_object_identifier":"","state":"active","version":null,"keywords":{"fr":["Pandémie de COVID-19","personnes susceptibles d’être gravement malades","personnes en situation de handicap"],"en":["COVID-19 pandemic","high risk population","people with disabilities."]},"relationships_as_object":[],"creator_user_id":"4cfa9a9c-1d95-40eb-86f9-bc0c8ec45d1f","title_translated":{"fr":"La COVID-19 et les personnes en situation de handicap au Canada","en":"COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada"},"type":"info","resources":[{"cache_last_updated":null,"unique_identifier":"","package_id":"f7960af8-5b1b-4ab1-b802-8b0b0be0bfa8","datastore_active":false,"character_set":"","related_type":"","state":"active","id":"c1fc6696-3706-439d-a7a7-a7fc21fe93b1","related_relationship":"","name_translated":{"fr":"La COVID-19 et les personnes en situation de handicap au Canada","en":"COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"HTML","date_published":"","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada","language":["en"],"created":"2020-05-13T15:31:15.070891","url":"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/people-with-disabilities.html","last_modified":null,"position":0,"revision_id":"64cd0d87-98f6-4392-8d75-edf9b89027c8","resource_type":"publication"},{"cache_last_updated":null,"unique_identifier":"","package_id":"f7960af8-5b1b-4ab1-b802-8b0b0be0bfa8","datastore_active":false,"character_set":"","related_type":"","state":"active","id":"a7e221c9-09dd-419a-a7c9-f2b118ce069f","related_relationship":"","name_translated":{"fr":"La COVID-19 et les personnes en situation de handicap au Canada","en":"COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada"},"hash":"","description":"","format":"HTML","date_published":"","mimetype_inner":null,"url_type":null,"mimetype":null,"cache_url":null,"name":"COVID-19 and people with disabilities in Canada","language":["fr"],"created":"2020-05-13T15:31:15.070898","url":"https://www.canada.ca/fr/sante-publique/services/maladies/2019-nouveau-coronavirus/document-orientation/personnes-handicapees.html","last_modified":null,"position":1,"revision_id":"64cd0d87-98f6-4392-8d75-edf9b89027c8","resource_type":"publication"}],"place_of_publication":[],"num_resources":2,"tags":[],"spatial":"","collection":"publication","org_title_at_publication":{"fr":"Agence de la santé publique du Canada","en":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},"date_published":"2020-05-07 00:00:00","issuance":"","groups":[],"license_id":"ca-ogl-lgo","data_series_name":{"fr":"","en":""},"relationships_as_subject":[],"license_title":"Open Government Licence - Canada","restrictions":"unrestricted","organization":{"description":"","created":"2016-09-23T17:25:57.068700","title":"Public Health Agency of Canada | Agence de la santé publique du Canada","name":"phac-aspc","is_organization":true,"state":"active","image_url":"","revision_id":"96161da6-edc7-4d1d-99e0-baac9df7b3b9","type":"organization","id":"1C71053B-AA64-4646-956B-41631C396018","approval_status":"approved"},"name":"f7960af8-5b1b-4ab1-b802-8b0b0be0bfa8","isopen":false,"additional_notes":{"fr":"","en":""},"departmental_identification_number":"","notes":"COVID-19 causes a respiratory type infection that is mild in most of the population but can be more severe in those who are older adults or those with chronic underlying conditions.
