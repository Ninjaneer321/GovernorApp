{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La justice réparatrice (JR) est une approche de justice axée sur l'examen des torts causés par le crime en tenant le délinquant responsable de ses actes et en donnant aux parties directement touchées par un crime (victime(s), délinquant et collectivité) l'occasion de déterminer leurs besoins respectifs et d'y répondre à la suite de la perpétration d'un crime. Elle appuie la guérison, la réinsertion sociale, la prévention de nouveaux préjudices et, dans la mesure du possible, la réparation.\r\n\r\nLa justice réparatrice offre donc aux victimes, aux délinquants et à la collectivité la possibilité de discuter des causes, des circonstances et des conséquences du crime et de répondre aux besoins qui en découlent. Ces processus sont guidés par des facilitateurs qualifiés de la JR et peuvent prendre différentes formes selon la collectivité, le programme, le cas, les participants ou les circonstances.","en":"Restorative Justice (RJ) is an approach to justice that focuses on addressing the harm caused by crime while holding the offender responsible for his or her actions, by providing an opportunity for those directly affected by crime – victims, offenders and communities – to identify and address their needs in the aftermath of a crime.
