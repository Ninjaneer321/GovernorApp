Lors d'activités estivales pendant la pandémie, des précautions supplémentaires devraient être prises pour aider à protéger les enfants et les jeunes, le personnel et les collectivités contre la COVID-19. Lorsque le nombre de cas sera à la baisse et que plus de personnes seront vaccinées contre la COVID-19, les provinces et territoires ajusteront les mesures de santé publique dans leurs régions. Il est important de tenir compte de toutes les restrictions propres à chaque province et territoire et de travailler en étroite collaboration avec les autorités locales de la santé publique lors de l'élaboration de la programmation d'été.","en":"This is the guidance document for organized summer activities for children and youth.
