{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Une organisation qui souhaite acquérir de nouveaux logiciels peut envisager d’utiliser les produits libres tout autant que les produits commerciaux. Les logiciels libres comportent certains avantages, car leur code source est accessible au public, ce qui en font une option abordable et souple pour les organisations. Or, ils peuvent engendrer leur lot de surprises. Bien qu’ils soient pratiques, les logiciels libres peuvent comporter des vulnérabilités et des risques pour la sécurité de votre organisation. Le présent document fait état de ces risques ainsi que des mesures à prendre pour les atténuer.\r\n","en":"When looking to acquire software, your organization might consider using open-source software (OSS), as well as commercially available products.
