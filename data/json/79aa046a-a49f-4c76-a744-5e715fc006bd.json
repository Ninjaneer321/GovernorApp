{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Les vaccins sont essentiels pour mettre fin à la pandémie. Il est important que toutes les personnes se fassent vacciner contre la COVID-19 lorsque leur tour viendra. Les vaccins aident à réduire les risques d'infection chez votre enfant. Ils agissent de concert avec les défenses naturelles de l'organisme pour développer une protection contre une maladie. La vaccination préviendra la maladie ou en minimisera les effets. Santé Canada a autorisé le vaccin de Pfizer-BioNTech contre la COVID-19 pour les jeunes âgés de 12 ans et plus. Les jeunes de 12 à 17 ans peuvent recevoir le même régime de 2 doses que celui recommandé pour les adultes.","en":"Vaccines are essential to help end the pandemic.
