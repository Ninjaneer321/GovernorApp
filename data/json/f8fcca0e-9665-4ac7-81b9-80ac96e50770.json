Plus précisément, l’étude analyse la notoriété et la connaissance du système de justice pénale et du droit criminel, ainsi que la confiance du public à leur égard. Elle examine également la façon dont les Canadiens perçoivent le système de justice pénale, tout comme les valeurs qu’ils souhaitent que le système de justice pénale reflète, ainsi que les priorités relatives aux questions de justice pénale. Un sondage à grande échelle, mené auprès de 4 200 Canadiens, sur la notoriété du\r\nsystème de justice pénale, de même que sur les principales perceptions, valeurs et\r\nattentes à son égard. Les répondants ont été sélectionnés au hasard dans le panel interne des Associés de recherche EKOS (Probit1).\r\n\r\nLa plupart des répondants du premier sondage ont pris part dans une certaine mesure ou directement au système de justice pénale, soit parce qu’ils connaissaient quelqu’un qui était une\r\nvictime ou une personne accusée, soit comme témoin. Environ une personne sur quatre a été victime d’un crime violent ou non violent. Certains répondants ont été accusés ou reconnus coupables d’un\r\ncrime, alors qu’un sur quatre est un membre de la famille d’une victime ou d’une personne accusée ou reconnue coupable d’un crime.
