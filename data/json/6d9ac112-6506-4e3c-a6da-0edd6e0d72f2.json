{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Cela permet à notre gouvernement de mieux comprendre les répercussions qu'ont nos positions en matière de litiges sur nos institutions publiques. Bien que le Comité ne soit pas habilité à prendre des décisions et qu'il ne donne aucune instruction à la procureur général, je suis reconnaissante à mes collègues pour les points de vue et les perspectives diversifiées dont ils me font part. Pour la première fois, un procureur général du Canada publiait un rapport sur les décisions et les stratégies mises en œuvre en matière de litiges au nom du gouvernement du Canada. Le rapport de cette année, qui met en lumière certaines des positions que nous avons adoptées en 2017, porte sur quatre grands thèmes : l'indemnisation pour les torts du passé, le maintien de notre engagement à l'égard des droits de la personne et de la Charte,  la défense de notre sécurité nationale et l'intervention devant les tribunaux dans l'intérêt public. Ces quatre thèmes s'inscrivent dans le contexte plus large de l'année 2017 : le 150e anniversaire de la Confédération, le 35e anniversaire de la Charte canadienne des droits des libertés et le 35e anniversaire de l'article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 et sa reconnaissance des droits des peuples autochtones.","en":"The Litigation Year in Review for 2017 is the second time that the Attorney General of Canada published a report on the litigation decisions and strategies used on behalf of the Government of Canada. This year’s report highlights some of the litigation positions we took in the course of 2017 and focuses on four main themes: compensating for past wrongs, maintaining our commitment to human rights and the Charter, defending our national security, and intervening before the courts in the public interest. These themes are situated within a greater narrative around: 150th anniversary of Confederation, the 35th of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the 35th anniversary of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and its recognition of the rights of Indigenous People’s. the litigation year in review also concerns itself with protecting national security, and making sure Canadians are aware that their rights are protected and not subject to the whims of the government that is in power.
