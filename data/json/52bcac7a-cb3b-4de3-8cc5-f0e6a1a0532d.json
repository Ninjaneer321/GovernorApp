{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Il est essentiel pour l’élaboration de politiques, les programmes et les activités de communication de sonder l’opinion publique sur des questions importantes pour le ministère. À cette fin, RHDCC a confié à Corporate Research Associates, Inc. (CRA) le mandat de mener un sondage d’opinion publique sur des enjeux centraux de son mandat de même que sur des questions nouvelles et émergentes. Cette étude visait à examiner trois questions émergentes (c’est-à-dire les partenariats sociaux, le système de revenus de retraite et le chômage persistant) dans le but d’utiliser les données recueillies pour étayer l’orientation stratégique de même que les communications concernant ces domaines prioritaires. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, on a réalisé 1 500 entrevues par téléphone avec des Canadiens de 18 ans et plus, dans les dix provinces (les territoires étant exclus). Les entrevues ont été réalisées entre le 8 et le 27 mars 2010, la durée moyenne des entrevues étant de 18 minutes.","en":"Gauging public opinion on important issues to the department is essential in the development of policy, programs, and communication activities.
