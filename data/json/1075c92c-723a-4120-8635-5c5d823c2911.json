{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Le TSPT est un trouble mental qui peut survenir après l’exposition à des événements potentiellement traumatisants sur le plan psychologique (par exemple, mort ou menace de mort, catastrophes naturelles, violence). Les symptômes du TSPT comprennent des souvenirs récurrents et pénibles, le fait d’éviter ce qui rappelle les événements et des troubles du sommeil. La pandémie de COVID-19 a eu un impact sur les individus, les familles et les communautés de diverses manières. Les facteurs de stress liés à la pandémie pourraient augmenter le nombre de Canadiens présentant des symptômes de TSPT. Les personnes qui avaient déjà le TSPT pourraient voir leurs symptômes s’aggraver.","en":"PTSD is a mental disorder that can happen after exposure to potentially psychologically traumatic events (e.g., actual or threatened death, natural disasters, violence).
