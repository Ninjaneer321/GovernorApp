{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Transports Canada (TC) et Services partagés Canada (SPC) sont fiers de souligner la mise en œuvre de la plus grande installation Wi-Fi du GC à ce jour au nouveau siège social de TC dans la région de la capitale nationale. Nous avons collaboré dès le début, en nous appuyant sur un partenariat solide à différents niveaux afin de mener à bien les multiples projets Wi-Fi et de résoudre efficacement les problèmes en cours de route.\r\n\r\nL’immeuble de 29 étages comprend un grand hall et peut accueillir plus de 4 000 employés mobiles. SPC a installé plus de 250 points d’accès et des kilomètres de câblage et a effectué de nombreuses heures d’essai et de configuration pour mettre en œuvre le service Wi-Fi du GC.\r\n\r\nFournir aux employés en déplacement les outils dont ils ont besoin pour être productifs est un élément important de la stratégie de modernisation de TC, et le Wi-Fi du GC est l’un de ses services de base. Les employés peuvent accéder aux systèmes dont ils ont besoin pour servir les Canadiens à partir de n’importe quel bureau, de n’importe quelle salle de réunion ou de l’aire des visiteurs.\r\n\r\nLe service Wi-Fi du GC, combiné au service d’accès à distance de SPC, permet d’outiller un effectif mobile et efficace.\r\n\r\nTC et SPC sont très fiers de cette réalisation et se réjouissent à l’idée d’entreprendre d’autres projets conjoints.","en":"Transport Canada (TC) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are proud to recognize the largest GC WiFi installation to-date at TC’s new headquarters in the National Capital Region.
