Lancé en 2011, le projet de centralisation du courrier a été entièrement mis en œuvre le 1er avril 2016. Par le truchement d’un partenariat avec Services publics et Approvisionnement Canada à Matane, au Québec, ou SPAC (Matane), les documents sont reçus à Matane, numérisés et téléchargés dans le système Réseau de prestation des services aux clients (RPSC) d’Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC).
