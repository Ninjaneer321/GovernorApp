{"notes_translated":{"fr":"Somme toute, le programme des paiements versés en replacement d'impôts administré par Services publics et Approvisionnement Canada (SPAC) distribue plus de 560 millions de dollars par année à quelque 1 100 autorités taxatrices d'endroits où sont situées des propriétés appartenant aux ministères fédéraux. Les paiements faits en vertu de la Loi sur les paiements versés en remplacement d’impôts sont basés sur le principe d’équité pour les autorités taxatrices et pour le gouvernement fédéral. Ces paiements sont également équitables par rapport à ceux que versent les autres propriétaires de biens immobiliers. Les paiements sont calculés en fonction des valeurs et des taux d’imposition qui, selon le ministre des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux, s’appliqueraient aux biens fédéraux s’ils étaient imposables. L’ensemble de données répertorie les données des PERI par année d’imposition : le nombre de demandes reçues, le nombre de paiements versé aux autorités taxatrices et le nombre de demandes finalisées avant le 31 mars.","en":"The Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program is administered by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC).
