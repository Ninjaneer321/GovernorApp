{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Le Conseil du Trésor, qui établit les lignes directrices pour tous les ministères gouvernementaux au Canada, définit une norme de service comme étant : « un engagement public d'assurer un niveau de service mesurable auquel les clients peuvent s'attendre dans des circonstances normales ». Ces normes aident les Canadiens en rendant officiel le type de service auquel ils peuvent s'attendre de tout ministère. Les normes aident également le personnel d'ACC en leur apportant des objectifs à atteindre - que ce soit à propos de leurs propres résultats ou bien pour informer le public sur ce à quoi il peut s'attendre. \r\n\r\nÀ l'heure actuelle, Anciens Combattants Canada a adopté vingt-deux normes de service touchant les principaux programmes et services offerts aux anciens combattants par le Ministère. Ces normes de service sont affichées sur le site Web; à l'avenir, le Ministère prévoit également ajouter les résultats correspondant à chaque norme de service.\r\n\r\nLa présente vérification visait à évaluer le processus d'examen et d'élaboration des normes de service, ainsi que l'exactitude des données des données faisant l'objet des rapports. La vérification porte sur les vingt-deux normes et les pratiques en vigueur à l'exercice 2011-2012. La vérification a débuté en octobre 2011, et l'analyse a été achevée en février 2012.\r\n","en":"Treasury Board, which sets the guidelines for all government departments in Canada, defines a service standard as \"a public commitment to a measurable level of performance [that] clients can expect under normal circumstances.\" These standards help Canadians by formalizing the kind of service that they can expect from any department.
