{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Les tribunaux constituent un pilier de la démocratie canadienne, offrent un service essentiel pour la population canadienne et apportent un soutien déterminant à l’activité économique. Néanmoins, les tribunaux ont été forcés de considérablement réduire leurs activités en raison de l’éloignement physique et d’autres exigences en matière de santé et de sécurité publiques.\r\n\r\nLe très honorable Richard Wagner, juge en chef du Canada et président du Conseil canadien de la magistrature, et l’honorable David Lametti, ministre de la Justice et procureur général du Canada, ont par conséquent mis sur pied un Comité d’action sur l’administration des tribunaux en réponse à la COVID-19.\r\n\r\nLe Comité d’action fournit un leadership national pour appuyer le travail des gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux, des différents tribunaux et de leurs administrateurs dans le rétablissement progressif du fonctionnement complet des tribunaux du Canada tout en assurant la sécurité des utilisateurs et du personnel.\r\n\r\nAu moment où la population canadienne et ses collectivités sortent de la crise actuelle et s’adaptent aux nouvelles réalités découlant de la COVID-19, les tribunaux joueront un rôle essentiel à une reprise nationale plus vaste. En fournissant aux décideurs provinciaux, territoriaux et judiciaires la meilleure information possible sur la santé et la sécurité, le Comité d’action les aide à assurer la sécurité et le bien-être des utilisateurs des tribunaux, tout en faisant progresser l’intérêt commun de la société canadienne à l’égard d’un système de justice sécuritaire et accessible.\r\n","en":"The courts are a pillar of Canada’s democracy, an essential service to Canadians, and a critical support to economic activity.
