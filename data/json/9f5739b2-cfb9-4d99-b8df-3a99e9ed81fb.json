{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"L’évaluation du Programme pour l’autonomie des anciens combattants (ci-après appelé le « Programme ») a été réalisée conformément au Plan d’évaluation pluriannuel axé sur les risques de 2015-2020 d’Anciens Combattants Canada (ACC). L’évaluation couvre la période du 1er avril 2010 au 31 mars 2015 et a été menée entre juin 2015 et janvier 2016.\r\n\r\nL’objectif du Programme est d’aider les bénéficiaires admissibles à demeurer chez eux et dans leur collectivité le plus longtemps possible en leur offrant une aide financière pour des services qui contribuent à favoriser et à soutenir l’autonomie et la santé. Selon les situations et les besoins en matière de santé, le Programme peut fournir une aide financière pour l’obtention de services comme l’entretien ménager, l’entretien du terrain, des soins personnels, l’accès à des services d’alimentation, et des services de santé et de soutien. Lorsqu’il n’est plus possible d’offrir des services à domicile, le Programme aide les vétérans à demeurer dans leur collectivité en leur offrant une aide financière pour l’obtention de soins intermédiaires dans des établissements communautaires (c’est-à-dire des établissements de soins infirmiers).\r\n\r\nL’évaluation a porté sur les éléments du Programme liés à l’entretien ménager et à l’entretien du terrain puisque : \r\n\r\n  * ces deux éléments combinés représentent 77 % des dépenses totales du Programme;\r\n\r\n  * des changements importants ont été apportés au mode de paiement pour ces deux éléments pendant la période visée par l’évaluation.\r\n","en":"The evaluation of the Veterans Independence Program was conducted in accordance with the Veterans Affairs Canada Multi-Year Risk-Based Evaluation Plan 2015-20.

Depending on circumstances and health needs, the Program can contribute to services such as housekeeping, grounds maintenance, personal care, access to nutrition, and health and support services.
