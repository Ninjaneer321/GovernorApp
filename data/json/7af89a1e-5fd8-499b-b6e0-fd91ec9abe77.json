{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"La pandémie de coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) [causée par le nouveau SRAS-CoV-2], qui constitue une urgence de santé publique de portée internationale, a déjà eu des répercussions sur de nombreux aspects de la prestation des soins de santé. Au Canada, toutes les provinces et tous les territoires ont pris une série de mesures de santé publique pour atténuer la transmission du SRAS-CoV-2 et réduire l’incidence de l’épidémie sur les systèmes de santé; dans certains cas, cela inclut le report de visites médicales non essentielles. Les vaccinations, plus précisément chez les nourrissons et les jeunes enfants, sont essentielles. Si la capacité n’est pas suffisante pour maintenir tous les programmes de vaccination systématique, l’accent doit être mis sur les séries primaires et les doses de rappel pour les enfants âgés de moins de deux ans.","en":"As a public health emergency of international concern, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus) has already impacted many aspects of healthcare delivery.
