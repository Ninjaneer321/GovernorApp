Les cours martiales sont conduites conformément à des règles et procédures similaires à celles des cours pénales civiles et ont les mêmes droits, pouvoirs et privilèges qu'une cour supérieure de juridiction pénale en ce qui concerne toutes les « questions nécessaires ou appropriées pour le bon exercice de [leur] juridiction","en":"The Office of the Judge Advocate General oversees the administration of military justice.
