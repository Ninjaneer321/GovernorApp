{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"L’évaluation du Programme des services de transition de carrière (STC) a été réalisée conformément au Plan approuvé d’évaluation pluriannuel axé sur les risques de 2012-2017 d’Anciens Combattants Canada. Les modalités relatives aux Services de transition de carrière étaient valides jusqu’au 31 mars 2016. \r\n\r\nLe Programme des services de transition de carrière a été établi en 2006 sous le régime de la Loi sur les mesures de réinsertion et d’indemnisation des militaires et vétérans des Forces canadiennes. Les politiques et les pratiques régissant le Programme ont été modifiées au fil des années, mais son objectif essentiel est demeuré inchangé, soit offrir aux vétérans et survivants admissibles une aide pratique à la recherche d’emploi pendant la transition de la vie militaire à la vie civile. \r\n\r\nDans le cadre des Services de transition de carrière, ACC rembourse les vétérans et les survivants admissibles jusqu’à hauteur de 1 000 $ (taxes comprises) à vie pour des services tels que l’orientation professionnelle, la formation en recherche d’emploi et l’aide à la recherche d’emploi. Des éléments du Programme actuel, notamment l’admissibilité, les limites d’aide financière et les fournisseurs de services, diffèrent du Programme à sa création en 2006. \r\n\r\nDans le cadre de l’évaluation, qui a été réalisée conformément aux exigences des politiques du Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor du Canada (SCT) et à l’orientation connexe du SCT, la pertinence et le rendement du Programme des services de transition de carrière ont été examinés. Les résultats et les conclusions de l’évaluation sont fondés sur l’analyse de multiples données probantes qualitatives et quantitatives.

Policies and practices have been modified over the years but its essential mission has remained unchanged; i.e., to provide eligible Veterans and survivors with practical help finding a job as they transition from military to civilian life.\r\n\r\nCTS reimburses costs for services such as career counselling, job-search training and job-finding assistance for eligible Veterans and survivors to a lifetime maximum of $1,000 (including tax).
