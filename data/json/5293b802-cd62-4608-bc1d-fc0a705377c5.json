On entend d’une menace interne toute personne qui connaît l’infrastructure ou l’information de votre organisation, ou qui y a accès, et qui utilise ses connaissances ou son accès d’une façon malveillante ou involontaire pour nuire à l’organisation. Les menaces internes peuvent poser des risques contre vos employés, vos clients, vos actifs, votre réputation et vos intérêts. Sachez que vous pouvez toutefois adopter des mécanismes de sécurité afin de réduire les risques connexes.\r\n","en":"This document focuses on the IT-related concerns regarding insider threats.
