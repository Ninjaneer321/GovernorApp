Pour cette raison, cette liste est incomplète et ne contient pas tous les employeurs qui ont soumis ou obtenu une EIMT.\r\n\r\nLes données contenues dans ce rapport couvrent seulement les postes de TET qui ont fait l’objet d’une EIMT. Il ne s’agit donc pas du nombre de permis de travail émis à des TET ou du nombre de TET entrant au Canada. La décision d'émettre un permis de travail relève d’Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada (IRCC); par conséquent, ce ne sont pas tous les postes approuvés qui aboutissent à l’émission d’un permis de travail ou à l’arrivée d’un TET au Canada. Les données incluent les postes qui ont été approuvés lors de l’EIMT ou qui, après approbation, ont été annulés par l’employeur.

A positive LMIA must be obtained by an employer before hiring a TFW for a specific occupation.\r\n\r\nThis list excludes all personal names, such as employers of caregivers or business names that use or include personal names. For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA.\r\n\r\nThe data provided in this report tracks TFW positions on Labour Market Impact Assessments only, not TFWs that are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. The decision to issue a work permit rests with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC); therefore, not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. The data includes all positions on all positive LMIAs as issued, and therefore also includes any position that may have been subsequently cancelled by the employer.

neutral impact on the Canadian labour market. A positive LMIA must be obtained by an employer before hiring a TFW for a specific occupation.\r\n\r\nThis list excludes all personal names, such as employers of caregivers or business names that use or include personal names. For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA.\r\n\r\nThe data provided in this report tracks TFW positions on Labour Market Impact Assessments only, not TFWs that are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. The decision to issue a work permit rests with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC); therefore, not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. The data includes all positions on all positive LMIAs as issued, and therefore also includes any position that may have been subsequently cancelled by the employer. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nEffective February 2018, Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) Foreign Worker System changed to the LMIA System.\r\nLMIAs in support of Permanent Residence (PR) are excluded from TFWP statistics reporting, unless reported separately. This may impact statistics reported over time.\r\nCountry of citizenship information are replaced with country of residence information, reflecting current data collection policies of the LMIA System.\r\n\r\n Should an employer wish to contact ESDC concerning the accuracy of this information, please contact NA-TFWP-PTET@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.","owner_org":"055ADCD8-8FDA-40DA-A5B7-689FF7DB57A6","audience":[],"license_url":"http://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada","program_page_url":{"fr":"","en":""},"title":"Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP): Positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) Employers List","revision_id":"a383de37-bd3d-4ebd-a8c1-3d50723b7bac"}
