{"issuance_frequency":"","notes_translated":{"fr":"Quand vous décidez d’une approche pour déployer des dispositifs mobiles dans votre organisme, vous pouvez choisir parmi différents modèles de déploiement ayant chacun leurs avantages et leurs risques. Pour ce qui est des dispositifs mobiles, la gestion des risques dépend en partie de la collaboration de l’employé (c.-à-d. sa volonté de permettre à l’organisme d’établir des restrictions d’utilisation ainsi que des modalités de surveillance et d’accès de sécurité) et en partie des risques et des vulnérabilités liés aux types de dispositifs offerts. Afin de choisir un modèle de déploiement qui équilibre le mieux ces éléments pour votre organisme, considérez l’expérience utilisateur, la confidentialité et les exigences de sécurité.\r\n","en":"When selecting an approach to deploy mobile devices in your organization, you can choose from different deployment models, each of which comes with its own benefits and risks.
